PREFACE TO PERIOD III
</p>

<p>
In this third and final volume of the Greatest Story
in the World I have tried to give an outline sketch of
the happenings of the last five centuries.  It is the
period which must appeal more forcibly than any earlier
time to all of Anglo-Saxon race, because it is the
Anglo-Saxon race that plays by far the largest role in it, and
a role which becomes of constantly increasing interest
right down to the present day.  We first see Great
Britain, in the gallant figures of Elizabeth's sea-captains,
as chief actor in thwarting the aims at world
empire of Spain.  A little while, and we see her again
taking the lead in abating the arrogance of the Grand
Monarque, Louis XIV. of France.  But of far greater
importance than even this checking of the powers of
the would-be masters of the world is that part which
fortune or Providence assigned to her to play so
conspicuously throughout the second half of the period
which this volume covers&mdash;the part of mother of nations.
It is thus that the historian, J. R. Green, writes
of her as she appeared to the world after the United
States had fought their way to independence&mdash;not
a nation broken by her loss, as all had perhaps expected
to find her, possibly a sadder and certainly a wiser
nation, but, most surprising of all, stronger and more
adventurous.
</p>

<p>
These are Mr. Green's words: "From the moment
of the Declaration of Independence it mattered little
whether England counted for less or more with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
nations around her.  She was no longer a mere
European power, no longer a mere rival of Germany
or Russia or France.  She was from that hour a
mother of nations....  And to these nations she
was to give not only her blood and her speech, but
the freedom which she had won.  It is the thought
of this which flings its grandeur round the pettiest
details of our story in the past.  The history of France
has little result beyond France itself.  German or
Italian history has no direct issue outside the boundaries
of Germany or Italy.  But England is only a small
part of the outcome of English history.  Its greater
issues lie not within the narrow limits of the mother
island, but in the destinies of nations yet to be.  The
struggles of her patriots, the wisdom of her statesmen,
the steady love of liberty and law in her people at
large, were shaping in the past of our little island the
future of mankind."
</p>

<p>
The greatest part, in fact, of this Greatest Story
for the last hundred and fifty years has been made
in England.  That is, indeed, much to say, but it is
not too much.
</p>

<p>
In this volume I have thought best not to take up
space with description of the way in which men have
so lately lived, have built their houses, and so on.
I have assumed that all this would be more or less
familiar to my readers from other books and pictures
and talk.  And not even in vaguest outline have I
attempted a sketch of the Great War and its effects.
The moving picture which I have tried to make
intelligible stops before the curtain is rung up on that
grim tragedy whose import we do not even now fully
understand.
</p>

<p>
And yet again my best thanks are due to
Mr. R. B. Lattimer for valuable criticisms and suggestions.

THE GREATEST STORY IN THE WORLD
</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
HOW MAN SAILED EAST AND WEST
</h3>

<p>
Suddenly, at the end of the fifteenth century, the
persons of our story found the picture of the world
which they carried in their minds wonderfully expanded,
rather as if it were a closed fist widely opening.
Columbus in 1492 "discovered America": Vasco
da Gama, in 1487, "rounded the Cape of Good Hope."
</p>

<p>
That is the way in which most of the history books
state it for us; but it is a statement which gives credit
to Columbus for a little more than he actually did,
and does not put enough to the credit of da Gama.
For it was not what we call America at all which
Columbus discovered in 1492, but only one of what
we now know as the West Indies, or West Indian
Islands: and the mere "rounding" of the Cape of
Good Hope had been done by another before da Gama,
but da Gama, after "rounding" and sailing up the
eastern coast of Africa, struck across to the western
coast of India.  As a feat of navigation his voyage
was far greater than that of Columbus.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Vasco da Gama
</span>
</p>

<p>
Thus Vasco da Gama, going eastward, reached the
western coast of India, and Columbus, going westward,
reached the "West Indies."  The name is worth
noting.
</p>

<p>
These islands, as further exploration showed them
to be, were called "West Indies," because men had
expected to reach India by sailing west.  The
geographers had no conception of the great continent
of America and the vast ocean of the Pacific that lay
between the land touched by Columbus and the land
which he thought that he had touched.
</p>

<p>
No matter.  He came back with a very marvellous
story&mdash;a story which grew ever more marvellous as
further exploration revealed the astonishing truth.
</p>

<p>
What made this discovery of America so intensely
exciting was that it was discovery of a land wholly
new and unexpected.  Although the voyage of Vasco
da Gama to India was a new and remarkable achievement
in navigation, the people in the West, the only
people with whom this "greatest story" has been
concerned until this time, were tolerably informed
about the East.  But its story had never before come
into their own and mingled itself with their own so
that each should have an effect and make a change
in the other, as did begin to happen now.
</p>

<p>
The "New World," as it was called, of America,
unlike the East, scarcely had a story at all.  A few,
a very few, historical records were discovered by
the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru.  The inhabitants
whom the Spaniards found there had been workers
in gold and silver, and the riches which Spain obtained
by robbery of this treasure and, later, by working the
gold mines and silver mines from which the precious
metals were taken, made a large difference, as we
shall see, in the history of men in Europe.  But for
the rest the "New World" had no history, no activities,
which worked into and altered the history of the old.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
The old world was vastly affected by the discovery
nevertheless.  Just because it was so new, and occupied
by savages who were able to make very little resistance
to invasion, it enlarged the actual size of the world
both for men's imaginations and also as a place for
them to live in.  But except for the treasure which
the Spaniards took, it had little to send back to the
old world.  All else was a going out of the old world
to the new.
</p>

<p>
Da Gama did not discover a new world.  He
merely&mdash;but it made a vast difference to the
story&mdash;proved possible a new and far more convenient route
to a country already known.  Thus he brought that
known land into contact with Europe so that the story
of the far East interpenetrated the European story
as it never had done before.  The whole, in fact, became
one world-wide story.
</p>

<p>
The East had been sending her produce to the West
ever since the West&mdash;by which term we here mean
Europe&mdash;had been civilised enough to need and to
value it.  There was a very ancient overland route
from the north-west of India through Persia and
Mesopotamia to Tyre and the Mediterranean coast.
Another way was oversea from some Indian port as
far as the head, that is to say the northern end, of the
Persian Gulf, and thence, as before, overland to a
port on the coast of Syria.  And thirdly, there was a
route by longer sea, again starting from India, calling
perhaps at one or two ports in Arabia and up through
the Red Sea.  At a port in the Red Sea the goods would
be landed and taken, probably on camel-back, to the
Nile, and would be brought down the river and
transhipped at its mouth into vessels which would
carry them to Venice or Genoa.
</p>

<p>
The chief Indian port from which the trading
vessels sailed, whether to the Persian Gulf or to the
Red Sea, was Calicut, which we still see marked on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
the maps of India.  It is a town on what is called
the Malabar Coast, on the western side of India, low
down towards the west.
</p>

<p>
And not only did ships bearing the produce of
India start from Calicut, but Calicut was also the
port to which came ships, some of them of great size,
from the farther East, bearing the silks of China, the
spices of the islands of the Malay Archipelago, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
All the carrying trade west of Calicut seems to
have been in the hands of Mahommedans, by far the
most part of them being Arabs, at the date of da
Gama's adventurous voyage to India.  It was, of
course, by far the more adventurous and full of danger
for that very reason, because here was he, a Christian,
and therefore to be regarded as almost their natural
enemy by all good Mahommedans, coming to interfere
with a trade which they had made their own.
</p>

<p>
It does not seem possible that they did not realise
what his coming was likely to mean for the future of
that trade.  The Arab traders themselves knew the
eastern coast of Africa at least as far south as
Mozambique, for it was at this point that da Gama
first came into touch with them.  And it is probable
that they knew the African coast further south also.
They must have realised that ships going round the
Cape of Good Hope could carry goods from India to
Europe very much more cheaply than they could
be transported by means which involved several
transhipments, the payment of duties at several ports,
and a longer or shorter carriage overland.
</p>

<p>
The wonder is that da Gama, going with only three
vessels and of no great size&mdash;they were of the kind
that were known as caravels&mdash;was ever allowed by
the Moslems to come home again.  But he artfully
pretended to them that these three were only part of
a larger fleet from which they had become separated,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
and it may be that this pretence imposed upon the
Arabs and deterred them from doing him any injury.
As it was, he was imprisoned for awhile by one of the
Sultans, or rulers of a territory on the Indian coast,
but by some means he conciliated his captor and was
allowed to trade and go home again with his ships
laden with silks, pearls, rubies, and a variety of treasure.
The question that naturally occurs now is why
it should have been the Portuguese, of all the European
nations, that were led to undertake this sailing round
Africa.  The answer is interesting, because it involves
an explanation of a curious idea of the geographers
of the day.
</p>

<p>
We saw, in the second volume of this Greatest Story,
Arabs and Moors established along the fertile fringe of
Northern Africa.  Northward of this fringe lay the
Mediterranean; behind it, that is to say to the south,
the desert.  But the African tribes had penetrated
and traversed this desert.  They had learnt that there
was, on the far side of it, a fertile land again, a land
which was later known as Guinea.  And this land
was watered by a great river, now known as the
Senegal river, flowing from the east and coming out
into the sea in the Gulf of Guinea.  It appeared
to come from much the same direction as that in which
they rightly supposed lay the sources of the Nile, the
river of Egypt; and they seem to have imagined it
a western branch of that ancient river.  If they could
mount up this branch then far enough in their boats
they deemed that they might come out on the Nile,
and so, if they pleased, arrive again on the
Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The land of slaves
</span>
</p>

<p>
Apart from this idea, the land in itself was rich and
produced much that they valued&mdash;gold dust and ivory
in the elephants' tusks which the natives brought
or barter with them&mdash;but above the ivory and gold
and the rest of the rich products they valued the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
natives themselves, whom they captured and brought
to markets in the Mediterranean towns and sold for
slaves.  Slaves had a value then which is not easy
for us to realise to-day when our great difficulty is
to find work for men to do.  At that time the difficulty
was to find men to do the work; and perhaps this was
more true of Portugal and Spain than of other European
countries, because so much of their territory lay
uncultivated and waste by reason of the continual
wars which had been waged between the Christians and
the Moors.  They needed men badly to till those
waste lands.  This fertile country then, south of the
extensive tract of desert, had much that might attract
the Spaniard or the Portugee.
</p>

<p>
We do not know very precisely why it was that
little Portugal, rather than great Spain, sent out
the mariners which worked southward along the
western coast of Africa.  We do not know, but perhaps
we may make a guess.  Spain had a large stretch
of coast, with many ports, along the Mediterranean,
and it is likely that Portuguese vessels would not
have been very welcome if they tried to trade in
that direction.  Moreover, the Mediterranean swarmed
with pirates, both of Mahommedan and Christian
nations.  It was no peaceful sea for the trader.  Again,
Spain had a long coast line northward and
north-eastward right away to where the Pyrenees come
up to the Bay of Biscay.  There was no warm welcome
there for ships encroaching on Spanish trade.  Therefore,
if the Portuguese sailors were to be adventurous
at all there was no other very apparent direction for
their enterprise to take than that of the western coast
of Africa and of the islands that lay off it, such as
Madeira, the Canaries, and the Cape Verde islands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Portuguese adventurers
</span>
</p>

<p>
And there can be no doubt about the adventurous
spirit of the Portuguese sailors of that day.  They
were inspired by the spirit of adventure, but also&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
human motives are generally mixed&mdash;the adventure
attracted them by the profits to be gained in it, the
gold and the slaves.  Further, we have to credit
them with a more noble and spiritual motive, for they
were inspired with a fervent conviction that it was a
work most pleasing to God to induce the natives of
new-found lands to become Christians.  The means
employed to this end were often cruel, but we ought
to realise that it was a very real motive, both with
the Spaniard and the Portugee.  It is a motive which
gives dignity to their conquests.  They were not
undertaken solely for material gain.  Even if the means
were cruel by which they converted a savage, whether
of Africa or of America, they believed that it was
in the truest sense a kindness to be thus cruel, if by so
dealing with his body his soul might be saved.
</p>

<p>
Such motives as the above had their influence not
only with the adventurers themselves, but also with
the Governments of their countries.  A member of
the Royal family of Portugal, known in story as Prince
Henry the Navigator (1394-1460), especially favoured
and helped to equip these expeditions.  He was
grandson of our own John of Gaunt.  Perhaps his
title of "Navigator" was cheaply earned, for there
is no evidence that he ventured far oversea himself,
but the distant voyages owed very much of their success
to his assistance.
</p>

<p>
Thus the Portuguese crept farther and farther
down the African coast until at length they rounded
it, and in the last years of the fifteenth century da
Gama achieved the great adventure.  He must have
deemed himself uncommonly fortunate to come home,
with those three "caravels," to his native land, and
that he was considered to have been favoured by
fortune we may gather from Portugal's later conduct.
Her rulers were far from trusting that it would be
always so&mdash;that her trading ships might always go
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
safely voyaging in those seas which the Moslems had
hitherto deemed to be their own.  One fleet, more
powerful and more numerous than da Gama's poor
three ships, was sent out, and again another, greater
still, until the Portuguese had taken all the chief
ports&mdash;Mozambique, on the eastern shore of Africa itself,
the ports commanding the entries of the Red Sea and
of the Persian Gulf&mdash;had penetrated farther east and
captured the great trading port of Malacca, had even
landed in China, and had established their headquarters
at Goa, in the Indian peninsula.
</p>

<p>
It is not the least wonderful part of the whole
surprising story that they should have made this
conquest so completely and so easily.  We must
attribute it to the superiority of their ships in
comparison with those of the Arabs and other Moslems in
that sea, to their better armament and to their greater
skill in using these ships for naval battle.  Had the
Mahommedans of that ocean possessed anything like
the ships and the experience of marine warfare that
sailors of the same religion in the Mediterranean had
acquired by perpetual sea-fighting, it is not possible
that Portugal could have dominated them so decisively
and at such slight cost to herself.  Besides that the
Portuguese could manœuvre far more skilfully with
their ships, and knew how to combine them for attack,
the guns which their ships carried seem to have been
far more powerful than any that the Moslems had,
whether ashore or afloat; for not only do we find them
gaining the victory in all the naval battles, but they
employed their ships' guns in bombarding the ports
and combining the bombardment from the sea with
attacks by their landing forces.
</p>

<p>
The result of it all was that within a dozen or so
years of da Gama's reaching India the Portuguese
were the masters of those seas, and had the whole of
that trade in their hands.  And while Portugal thus
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
worked her way to the dominance of the eastern sea,
Spain was confirming the conquests for which Columbus
had pointed her the way in the West.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Atlantis
</span>
</p>

<p>
For some years there had been vague rumours in
Europe of an island far out in the western sea, and
a still more confident idea that if men could sail
westward far enough they would come to the eastern
side of Asia.  That was the goal at which they aimed,
in the westward sailing.  Columbus' special genius
and courage inspired him to go bravely on this western
cruise, not troubling himself, as others had done
before him, with the search for that fabulous island,
of Atlantis, supposed to be somewhere in the
mid-ocean, but holding his way continuously towards
the sunset until he did at length touch a land which
he thought to be that eastern Asia which he had set
out to look for.
</p>

<p>
We know how that it was something very different.
During the next few years Spain kept sending out
expedition after expedition, to find out what sort of
new world it was that this bold sailor had thus reached.
To Spain fell the enterprise and the conquest first,
but not by any natural sequence of events, for it was
truly due to the genius of Columbus, who was a man
of Genoa, and no son of Spain at all, that the first
enterprise of discovery was undertaken.  He could
not attempt it at his own cost.  His native state would
not furnish him with the means.  For four years he
was trying to get his voyage "financed," as we should
say now&mdash;that is, get its expenses paid&mdash;by the
Governments either of Spain or of England.  He had
a brother working to this end at the English Court,
while he was pleading his own cause at the Court of
Spain.  Our Henry VII. was just beginning to
listen favourably to the prayer of the brother, when
Isabella, joint ruler, with Ferdinand, of Spain, was
won by the eloquence of Christopher Columbus.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
Spain equipped the ships, and England, whether for
her good or her ill it is interesting to speculate, but
impossible surely to know, lost her chance of achieving
the astonishingly rich conquest which thus came to
Spain.
</p>

<p>
For what the repeated Spanish expeditions established
ever more conclusively was the amazing richness
of the new world, or, at least, of that part of it which
she was first to conquer.  And yet, at the beginning,
there was some disappointment.  We have seen how
one of the great needs of these countries of the old
world was men to cultivate their war-wasted lands.
This man-power they were constantly hoping to increase
by acquiring slaves.  Portugal did acquire slaves,
who proved excellent workers, from Africa.  The
slaves which the first conquerors of the West brought
to Spain were nearly useless.  The Red Indian, as it
became the fashion to call him later, has never been
of any value, as the African negro and the East
Indian "coolie" have been valuable, in the service
of the white man.
</p>

<p>
Thence, just at first, arose disappointment in
Spain.  But later, as the treasures in gold and silver
and gems of the new land were brought over and
became known and appreciated, there was ever
growing joy and triumph over the El Dorado&mdash;the
Golden Land&mdash;which had thus surprisingly been added
to the Spanish Crown.  There were new riches,
without limit, to be brought home, new souls, beyond
number, to be saved.  Priests went out with the
conquerors.  It was a spiritual, as well as a material
conquest.  Immense treasure was taken when in
1521 Cortez made himself master of Mexico, and twelve
years later the yet greater wealth of Peru was added
by the conquest of Pizarro.
</p>

<p>
And it was a conquest and a source of riches with
which at first no other country interfered.  We have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
seen, however, that Columbus in the first instance,
sailing west, had supposed himself to arrive on the
eastern shore of Asia and of India&mdash;the eastern shore,
that is to say, of the very land at which the Portuguese
arrived by sailing east.  It was apparent then that
if these voyagings were prolonged far enough the
ships must meet, or at least must cross each other's
path.  Therefore the two nations came to an agreement
between themselves for the amicable partition
of the world.  It was arranged that Spain should
have all lands, that she should conquer from any
non-Christian peoples, to the west of a line drawn from
north to south half-way between the Azores and the
West Indies, and that Portugal should have the lands
that she might similarly conquer to the east of that
line.  Each country would establish the Christian
Church in its conquered territories; and the division
was sanctioned by the Pope in a "Bull," as the Papal
pronouncement is called, dated as early as 1493.
</p>

<p>
The northern nations of Europe paid only a partial
respect to the Bull.  Before the close of the fifteenth
century Henry VII. of England had given a charter
to a Venetian seaman&mdash;he had learnt his seamanship
in Venice, though he, like Columbus, was a Genoese
by birth&mdash;Cabot and his three sons to claim as
England's possession any non-Christian lands that
they might discover in the West.  This charter,
however, was expressly stated to apply to the northern,
western, and eastern seas, but not the southern, a
restriction which obviously shows that the rights of
Spain and Portugal in the south were observed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
America
</span>
</p>

<p>
Long years before this, Northmen, as is told in
the Saga of Eric the Red, sailing from Iceland and
going west, had come to a land which they had called
Vineland the Good.  It is supposed to have been
either Newfoundland or the mainland of North
America.  Very likely they touched both.  There is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
a small grape that grows there which might justify
the name.  They tried to form a settlement there,
but the settlers were all murdered by the natives, and
the attempt was not repeated.  From the port of Bristol
there was commerce with Iceland.  There can be no
doubt that sailors brought the account of this
enterprise, and of this Vineland, to Bristol.  When the
Cabots went westward it is likely that it was this land
which they had a mind to seek.
</p>

<p>
The result of their expedition was that they reached
and explored the western coasts of Newfoundland
and of Labrador, but found nothing of such promise
as tempted them to bring back any glowing reports
of the new-found land.  Its effect was indeed to
extinguish the interest of England in these western
voyages for many years.
</p>

<p>
In the very last year of the century the coast of
South America was touched by two expeditions, one
Spanish, the other Portuguese.  The former had on
board that Amerigo Vespucci who later wrote an
account of the voyage and after whom America has
its name.  The expedition with which Amerigo sailed
touched the coast of what we now call Brazil, and it
seems to have been a surprise to discover that this
part of the continent lay within the north and south
line which had been drawn on the chart to define the
westernmost possession of the Portuguese.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A circumnavigation
</span>
</p>

<p>
Within the first quarter of the following century
the Spaniards exploring northward had proved the
continuity of the great continent with that land which
Cabot had reached.  Southward a Portugee, Magellan,
had sailed through the straits which bear his name,
had rounded Cape Horn and come out into the Pacific.
This boldest perhaps of all seamen, in an age of bold
seamen, pressed still westward over the ocean, to meet
his death from the spear of a native in the far west
islands of the Philippines.  He had, in fact, made
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
real the vision of Columbus&mdash;to reach the East by
sailing west.  His ship, the <i>Victoria</i>, returned safely
to Europe, being the first to accomplish a
circumnavigation, or voyage round the world, in 1522.  The
voyage had occupied three years all but a fortnight.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE STORIES OF THE OLD EAST AND OF THE NEW WEST
</h3>

<p>
The story of the New World before the coming of the
Spaniards may be told shortly because we know so
little of it.
</p>

<p>
At its far north-westerly corner the Continent of
America is divided from Asia by a narrow strait.  It
is a shallow strip of ocean, and there is no doubt that
there was a time when it did not exist as a dividing
barrier, and that animals&mdash;man among the rest&mdash;poured
into America from Asia at what was then a
point of junction between them.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore generally thought that it was from
the great birthplace and nursery of the human race,
the central and northern parts of Asia, that the
American continent was populated.  The so-called
Indian tribes which still exist both in North and South
America are supposed to be the descendants of those
Asiatic immigrants.  One might almost say of them
that they have no story, in the sense of any record
along the lines of what we know as human progress
in other parts of the world.  Apart from what they
have learnt from the white man since the year 1500&mdash;and
unhappily they learned from him much evil, as
well as good&mdash;they still represent what we imagine
mankind generally to have been in nearly the earliest
days of his existence as man and as something better
than the apes.  They represent man in the hunting
phase: that is to say before he passed into the second
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
of the three recognised phases and became pastoral,
a keeper of flocks and herds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Red Indian
</span>
</p>

<p>
Some historians and students of man's story tell
us that a principal reason why the Indians of America
had gone so little way in civilisation was because
that great country had been so ill-supplied by nature
with the species of animals which man has domesticated
to his service.  It has been said that America has no
animals that could serve to develop the pastoral
phase, no sheep or cattle.  It may be so, yet I scarcely
think that we can build the explanation very
confidently on that as a foundation, for we do not know
what man might or might not have done, in course
of many generations, in domesticating some of the
native animals of America.  The only one that he
does seem to have domesticated is the dog, and the
dog he may have brought with him from Asia, or may
have domesticated from one or other species of the
American wolf.  He had no horses before the Spaniards
came, and it has been conjectured that one of the
reasons why the Indians were conquered so easily
is that they then saw for the first time a man on
horseback, and thought that they were meeting some
supernatural creature of unknown powers.
</p>

<p>
But America had its bison, commonly called
buffalo, in countless numbers.  Who can say that
they might not have been trained to do service for
man as readily as the wild cattle of Asia?  America
has its caribou, a kind of deer closely akin to the
reindeer which is the invaluable servant of the
Laplanders.  There are native mountain sheep, and in the
south there are the llama and the vicuna, which are
species intermediate between the sheep and the camels.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it is difficult to be sure that it was any
lack of animals capable of domestication that
prevented the early inhabitants of America from passing
into the pastoral stage.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
</p>

<p>
And then, most interestingly and most strangely,
it appears that there were certain places in which,
even before the Spaniards came, the Indians had
cultivated plants&mdash;notably that maize, sometimes called
Indian corn, which certainly seems as if it must
have been imported into North America from the
south.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-016"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-016.jpg" alt="MEXICAN PICTURE WRITING.">
<br>
MEXICAN PICTURE WRITING.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, when the Spaniards came to Mexico,
and again, and yet more strikingly, when they came
to Peru, they found evidence of a civilization very
much higher than that to which the great majority of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
the inhabitants of the country had attained.  They
found finely worked treasures of silver and gold; they
found large stone monuments.  One circular stone
which I have myself seen in the City of Mexico, called
"The Calendar Stone," was engraved with signs which
showed that the Mexicans had a system of reckoning
time and the seasons of the year.  They had a means
of communicating thoughts and of recording facts
by picture writing.  They had large works in stone,
for the conduct of water and for irrigation.  When
the Spaniards came to know something of the ways of
thought and of the religion of the people, they found
that the sun was the great god of their worship.  They
also had the hideous practice, but a practice which
we saw in the first volume of this Greatest Story to
be a very ancient and universal one, of sacrificing
human victims, with the idea that the blood received
into the ground would dispose the Earth deity to grant
them good harvests.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Egypt and Mexico
</span>
</p>

<p>
These are ideas and practices which must recall
very strikingly much of what we know about the
religion of the ancient Egyptians; and in Peru,
particularly, were found other practices which might be
thought to point to Egypt as their source.  Is it at all
possible that they really may have come thence?
There is a theory about man's story in the world
which would answer "yes," and it is a theory which
seems to be gaining adherents.
</p>

<p>
According to this theory, explorers, belonging to
the date of the ancient sun-worship in Egypt, pushed
out from that country adventurously in search of
certain definite objects.  Chief among those objects
were gold and pearls.  And they were sought and
prized not only because of their rarity and beauty,
but far more because they were considered to have
certain magical qualities, to be great "life-givers."  The
theory then is that the explorers&mdash;who were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
sun-worshippers, who offered human sacrifices, made
stone-works, understood irrigation and were
distinguished by other practices and beliefs&mdash;travelled
widely in search for these "life-givers."  Traces of
their sojourn, it is claimed, are to be found in India,
in the chain of islands which is called Indonesia, thence
onwards through other islands of the Pacific, until
finally we find them on the American continent, in
Mexico and Peru, and in various places in North
America.  Their traces are in the north of Europe
also.  These traces consist chiefly in large stone
works.  One or other, and in some places many, of
the distinctive elements of the civilisation and religion
of ancient Egypt are to be found among the peoples
who live where the ancient stone works are.  Very
commonly they have the belief that there was once
among them a ruling family who were "children of
the sun," whose forefather actually was the sun
himself, to whom, according to some legends, they
would return at death.  It was the belief that the
Spaniards were the sun children, or sun-gods, come
again, which greatly assisted them in their conquest
of Mexico, and perhaps of Peru also.  In the latter
country there still existed, at the time of its conquest,
the custom common among some of the Pharaohs of
Egypt, for the ruler to take his own sister for his queen.
Besides its interest, this is a theory which gives a
plausible account of facts, such as the stone working
and the widely spread belief in the sun children,
which are otherwise very difficult to explain.  But it
is not to be taken as proved, nor even as generally
accepted.
</p>

<p>
In Peru, exceptionally, the Spaniards found a
distinct race, the Incas, supposed to be descended
from the sun, still ruling, and ruling with a singular
benevolence.  But throughout the whole of the rest
of the continent, North and South, the natives had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
made very little progress along any lines of civilisation.
Here and there was some cultivation, chiefly of the
Indian corn; but generally the people were hunters,
going nearly naked in the warmer regions, clad in the
skins of beasts in the colder climates, poorly armed with
bows and arrows.
</p>

<p>
Thus obscure and scanty is the story of this great
newly found world of the Spaniards.  In the East, on
the other hand, were lands whose stories dated, with
actual records, thousands of years back.  There was
one, that wonderland of China, with earliest annals
between two and three thousand years before Christ&mdash;by
no means the oldest annals of humanity, but
incomparably older than those of any other empire
that still exists.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The permanence of China
</span>
</p>

<p>
That has been the chief wonder of the Chinese
Empire, its permanence.  And it is wonder that only
grows, the more we realise the nature of that empire
and the principles by which the society which has
held it so long together has been guided.  Again and
again conquerors have forced their way in upon it
from the north&mdash;rude, uncivilised tribes invading a
highly civilised land.  Again and again the chiefs of
the invaders have established themselves on the throne
of China.  They and their sons for many generations
have governed the land.  But the country generally,
with its vast extent and its large population, has gone
on its way very little troubled by the change of rulers.
Those military conquerors have in fact been themselves
conquered by the higher civilisation in which they have
found themselves.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese themselves appear to have come into
the country from the west.  Although they always
have been a people who held soldiers and the military
caste in very low esteem, they gradually pushed out
the original natives until their empire had boundaries
even more extensive than its present wide limits.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
It is one of the many wonders of this most singular
nation, that though it relied so little on force of arms
it gained a very marked respect from all the other
peoples of the East.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Confucius
</span>
</p>

<p>
Since the empire grew to be so vast, it is not
surprising that the great men far from the centre
became very independent, so that the social conditions
in the sixth century before Christ have been likened
to those feudal conditions which we saw prevailing
in Europe at a much later date.  Chinese rulers of
provinces have been written of as "feudal dukes."  And
just at that time, when the country was in the
disturbed state which such conditions made inevitable,
there arose two great teachers of whom the younger,
Confucius, exercised a very extraordinary influence
over all China, an influence that has force even
to-day.
</p>

<p>
He expounded sage maxims for man's conduct
towards his fellow-men, maxims not necessarily of his
own invention but taken from wise men before him.
"Do good," he enjoined, "not only to those who do
good to you, but to those who do you injury."  It had
been said even before him.  But to "do unto others
as you would they should do unto you" may be taken
as the principal basis of his own teaching, and the
Christian goes no further, in respect of man's "duty
to his neighbour."  But about man's duty towards
God Confucius had nothing to say.  Obedience and
piety of the son towards the father were, according to
him, "the beginning of virtue, that which distinguishes
man from the brutes."
</p>

<p>
And this relation and piety he conceived ought to
prevail all through the State.  The Emperor ought to
act as the father of his people, and the people ought
to be obedient to him, like his sons.  But he naïvely
qualified this, in a way calculated to prevent the
Emperor's acting as a tyrannical parent, by saying
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
that he forfeited his claim on this obedience if he
governed wrongly.
</p>

<p>
Confucius never claimed, as did Mahomet, for
instance, to be divinely inspired.  He came as a mere
man, preaching unselfishness and filial piety and the
duty of obedience and the beauty of goodness.  Those
to whom he preached accepted his words, and certainly
in some large measure formed their conduct accordingly.
It was a sermon advocating peace in a country
distracted by disturbances; and its ultimate effect is
that the Chinese even to-day are a peace-loving
nation.  For all that, the great empire has been the
scene of very frequent war, both by invaders from
without and rebels within; but unhappily that is the
state which has been usual throughout man's history
everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Confucius put the highest value on education.  In
the second century B.C. competitive examinations
began to be held for selecting ministers to posts in the
Government&mdash;a curiously democratic measure, and
perhaps possible in no other country than China.
Some of the scientific inventions, which have made
much difference in the story of the West, were known
in China far earlier than elsewhere&mdash;the power and
use of gunpowder, for instance, and the art and craft
of printing.  China discovered them early; but after
their first discovery she did not develop them at all,
as did the Western nations when they relearned them
or took them from her.
</p>

<p>
It was in the third century B.C. that one of the
world's wonders, the Great Wall of China, was
built&mdash;running west from the sea to a length of a thousand
and four hundred miles, and going over mountain and
valley without deviation.  Its purpose was to act as
a barrier, easy of defence, against the wild tribes that
pressed in from the north.  The Emperor under
whom this mighty, though not wholly effective, obstacle
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
was raised, was powerful enough to put down most of
the feudal dukes, and, much as the feudal dukes and
lords in Europe were replaced by the king's official
tax collectors, so in China, Viceroys of provinces,
appointed by the Emperor, took the place of the
dukes.  The Viceroys also were not always obedient
to the central power, but on the whole the change
made for peace within the empire.
</p>

<p>
Confucianism then, as the doctrine of that great
teacher was called, was not a religion, but merely a
system for the ordinance of man's life on earth,
without reference to a God; but about the same time as
Confucius, Buddha lived and founded the religion of
Buddhism in India; and in the first century
A.D. Buddhist missionaries came to China.  It is to this
influence that the pagoda-shaped temples are due which
are a prominent feature in Chinese scenery, for it was
in this form that the Buddhist temples were roofed.
The new religion gained numerous converts, and its
monasteries are many in China to this day; but it
really seems to have made but little difference in the
lives of the people&mdash;for two reasons.  First because
the Chinese are least ready to change their way of life
of any people in the world, and secondly because the
unselfishness, which is the leading principle in the
religion of Buddha, had been already preached as a
leading principle in the maxims of Confucius and of
wise men of China before him.
</p>

<p>
The general story of China nevertheless continues
to be the story of dissensions within the empire and
of uncivilised tribes threatening its borders on the
north and west.  Among these we may notice that
there were Huns, akin to those who threatened, and
from time to time overran, parts of Europe also.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Nestorians
</span>
</p>

<p>
Christianity was brought into the country probably
in the sixth century, by members of a Christian sect
called Nestorians, after a certain bishop Nestorius,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
their founder.  His doctrine respecting the divine and
human natures of Christ was condemned as unorthodox
both by the Church of Rome and also by the head
of the Eastern Church, at Constantinople.  The sect
had its headquarters in Syria, and was dispersed by
order of the Eastern Emperor.  The result was that
its members travelled and settled in Central and Eastern
Asia.  They were Asiatics and found themselves
among peoples well disposed towards them.  By this
violent dispersal of them the Emperor helped their
doctrines to prevail as he never could have helped
their prevalence by his greatest favours.  Incidentally,
one of the results of his action was that silkworms,
as we are told, were first carried to the West by some
of the Nestorians returning from the far East&mdash;the
ancient land whence silk had been brought for many
centuries.
</p>

<p>
Mahommedanism was introduced not very long
after, and the most interesting point to note about
these successively introduced religions is that all
seem to have been permitted and even encouraged
with equal favour, or with equal indifference, by the
Chinese rulers.  This was in strict accord with the
counsel of the sage Confucius, whose expressed opinion
was that the ruler should interfere as little as might
be with the life of his people.  And that life was still
principally influenced by the doctrines of Confucius,
no matter what religions were brought in.
</p>

<p>
Thus went the story of China through century after
century, with violent dissensions, yet never dissensions
deep enough or wide enough to create a real change
in an empire so vast and in a people so unwilling to
change.  We have to picture them living chiefly along
the river banks, cultivating the rice which was their
principal food, and with unwearied patience and
industry making their silk, from the cocoons spun by the
caterpillars, their beautiful porcelain, their lacquered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
furniture and vessels, their ivory carvings, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
And then, towards the end of the twelfth century,
began to rise to great power in Asia a people called the
Mongols.  Huns, Tartars, and Mongols we have to
look on as closely related; and to some degree the
last two names are interchangeable.  They were
divided into tribes under the rule of chieftains called
Khans; and over the whole was a chosen ruler named
the Khakan&mdash;the Khan of Khans.  Their numbers
grew.  They led the pastoral life.  As conquerors they
were as ruthless as the Huns from whom they were
descended, and at length, under the famous Kublai
Khan, they possessed by far the greater portion of
Asia and Europe as far as the boundaries of Poland.
Before the end of the thirteenth century Kublai Khan,
with his palace at Peking, dominated the whole of
China, and a vast portion of the earth's surface besides.
It was to his court that the famous Venetian traveller,
Marco Polo, made his way.  He lived there no less
than seventeen years in all, and probably at no other
time was it so easy for a western traveller to go to
China overland, because at no other time has there
been a single power which could ensure his safety on
so long a journey through lands in possession of such
lawless people.
</p>

<p>
On land, Kublai and his Mongols were irresistible,
but they failed entirely by sea in two expeditions
sent out to attempt the conquest of Japan.
</p>

<p>
Kublai's successors had little of what must have
been his very extraordinary genius, both for
government and war.  In the middle of the fourteenth
century a Buddhist monk headed a revolution in
China which was completely successful, and ended
with the expulsion of the Mongol conquerors and the
establishment of the monk on the throne as Emperor,
the first of the great Ming dynasty which lasted till
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
1626.  It was the last native dynasty to rule in China,
for in that year, 1626, the Manchus came in as
conquerors, and are there still.
</p>

<p>
The first of the Mings not only drove the Mongols
out of China, but defeated their principal armies so
decisively that it was the beginning of the end of their
power in other parts of Asia and in Europe.  The tribes
broke away from their dependence on the Khakan, or
central ruler, and with that loss of union their military
predominance was lost and they ceased to take nearly
so large a part in our story.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Japan
</span>
</p>

<p>
In striking contrast with China, Japan is a land of
no ancient story, and of recent civilisation.  It was
not until near the end of the third century A.D. that
Chinese writing and letters were brought into the
islands.  They were brought in from the independent
kingdom of Korea which we may see on the map
running down southward from Manchuria, that northern
province from which the Manchus came to conquer
China.  It shows how little we really know of Japanese
history, that though there is a legend that Korea was
conquered by Japan about the beginning of the
third century, modern historians are in much doubt
whether any such conquest actually occurred.  It
was, at all events, but temporary, and Korea soon
regained independence.  Its fortunes, or misfortunes,
however, play a very small part in this Greatest
Story.
</p>

<p>
Thus Chinese civilisation came to Japan, and was
followed by Buddhism replacing the ancient religion
of Shinto in which ancestor worship was the principal
element.
</p>

<p>
Buddhism was essentially a religion of peace, and
all the teaching of Chinese civilisation was opposed
to war.  The Chinese held the profession of arms,
the military caste, in the lowest esteem.  Therefore
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
it is very singular that Japan, in spite of Buddhism
and of this Chinese civilisation, gave highest possible
honour to her soldiers.  The Japanese had the greatest
reverence for their aristocracy, moreover&mdash;-for their
highly born&mdash;and the real government was in the
hands of one or other of the noble families.  The
country was distracted for years and years by
perpetual fighting between two of these great families
and their followers.  It is a story which may recall
our Wars of the Roses.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion of that long conflict was brought
about in what certainly was the greatest of naval
battles ever fought up to that time in any Asiatic
sea.  It is called the Battle of Dannoura and its date
is 1188.  More than a thousand junks, as the native
vessels are still called, took part in it, and by the
slaughter, both in the actual fighting and afterwards,
the defeated clan was all but wiped out of
existence.
</p>

<p>
It was cruel work, but it opened the way for a
period of comparative peace.  The mode of
government was reformed.  There was the Mikado, the
Emperor, by whom all power was supposed to be
wielded, and there was also an official called the
Shogun, the head of the army.  Perhaps we may
best designate his powers by calling him Commander-in-Chief.
But his authority was far more independent
than that of our highest military officer.  For centuries
the Shogun appears as the real power in the land,
although in theory his power is derived from the
Mikado.
</p>

<p>
After the victorious repulse of the great Kublai
Khan, above mentioned, the Daimios, as the great
nobles were called, again became powerful and
turbulent and the condition of the country when the
Portuguese first visited it, in the early years of the
sixteenth century, seems to have been not very unlike
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
that of Europe in the worst days of the fighting among
the feudal barons.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
India
</span>
</p>

<p>
In that disordered condition we have to leave,
for the time being, the story of the Yellow Race in
the Farthest East, and pass to the story of India
previous to the epoch-making voyage of da Gama.
</p>

<p>
In a former volume we noticed the "Indo-European"
as one of the great human families.  It
is a word which indicates an immigration of a people
from Central Asia into India and also into Europe.
The kinship of Indians with Europeans is testified
by the likeness of many words in the languages of
both.  Especially is this likeness apparent in the
words which express simple things, conveying ideas
which people would be likely to wish to communicate
to each other in a primitive state of society.
</p>

<p>
The immigrants found a people in the land before
them, and remnants of that people still remain.  In
India itself those survivors are called Dravidians,
and the Tamils of Ceylon are probably of the same
race.
</p>

<p>
The Indians or Hindus appear to have lived, from
their first coming into the land that we call India,
in village communities, each community independent
of the rest and producing all that its members needed.
It is very like the way in which we have seen that the
Germanic or Gothic tribes lived.
</p>

<p>
What is unlike those tribes is the "caste" system
which still prevails in India.  Their highest "caste"
was that of the Brahmans or priests who kept in their
own families the many secrets of a mysterious religion.
It consisted in "Nature worship," especially worship
of the forces that produce human food, and more
particularly worship of the sun.  Our knowledge of
it is derived from their sacred books, the Vedas and
others.  The Brahmans claimed that they were formed
by the Creator of the world from his mouth; the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
caste of soldiers, the military caste, from his arm; the
farmer caste from his thigh, and the tillers of the soil
from his feet.  There were other castes.  The divisions
were so very rigid that it was unlawful and irreligious
for one caste to do the work of another, to eat with
another, or to inter-marry.  The restrictions were
many and severe, and are but little relaxed even now.
They exist still as we find them laid down in a
Brahmany code called "The Laws of Manu," which
is supposed to date from the fifth century B.C.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Buddha
</span>
</p>

<p>
The institutions and manners of life in the East
have been very slow to change, in comparison with
the West, and it is likely that the life of these village
communities continued for many centuries to be
much as it had been when the immigrants first came
down from the north to that valley of the Indus
river which seems to have been their earliest place of
settlement.  And then, about 550 years before Christ,
or a little earlier, was born a wonderful man Buddha,
son of the Rajah of a small territory which is now
Nepal.  Here and there the headman of a village more
powerful than those about him had begun to exercise
some authority over more villages than one and to
be called a rajah: and of one such Buddha was
born.

<br>
STATUE OF BUDDHA.
</p>

<p>
When he came to manhood he was struck by the
misery of man's life in the world.  It appeared to
him that the first cause of all that misery was man's
selfish wishes, and his desire for all kinds of pleasure.
He arrived at the belief that if man could rid himself
of these desires his misery would cease.  One might
think that if this were so the simple remedy for it all
would be death.  But that was no remedy in the eyes
of Buddha, for he firmly believed that this life which
we lead here is but one in a cycle, or succession, of
lives which each soul has to live through.  The only
way then by which man's misery could be relieved
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
was that he should strive by all means to rid himself
of his desires, to become, as it were, selfless, that is
to say a creature not taking any satisfaction in gratifying
his natural desires.  And so convinced was this
young prince, or rajah, that it was thus and thus
only that man's grief could be assuaged, that he gave
up his princely position, he left wife and child and all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
his wealth and wandered in poverty about the world
preaching this doctrine.
</p>

<p>
No doubt it was developed by his followers&mdash;for
he quickly gained a numerous following&mdash;beyond his
own first ideas.  It taught that the final satisfaction
and peace of the soul of man was only to be won, after
many re-incarnations&mdash;that is to say, after living again
and again on the earth in different human bodies&mdash;by
being absorbed into some kind of universal or divine
soul which was called Nirvana.  In that state the
individual self of each soul would be lost, at length,
and it might know peace because all selfish desires
had gone from it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Buddhism
</span>
</p>

<p>
What he preached, then, was not quite unselfishness
as we understand it; for our unselfishness seems
to imply an active concern for the selves of other
people.  Buddha's idea was much more passive
than active.  We might better call it selflessness.
His great thought was how to get rid of all self, both
a man's own self and that of all others.  He did,
however, devote himself to what we may describe
even in our sense as a perfectly unselfish life, for he
not only denied himself all but the barest necessities,
but went through northern India trying to save other
men from what he considered, and pitied, as their
misery, by explaining to them how he thought they
might escape from it.
</p>

<p>
The theory of re-incarnation opened a way for
the union of Buddhism with the older Brahmanism,
for the priests taught that in Buddha himself was the
incarnated soul of Vishnu, the supreme spirit of the
Brahmans.  So they taught, and who was there to
contradict them?
</p>

<p>
For the regulation of social life the maxims of
Buddha are such as the highest Christian morality
must approve.  Hatred was to be conquered by love.
Wives, children, and servants were to be treated with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
wise kindness.  After a while, as has happened with
other religions, the followers of Buddhism split up
into sects, and especially into what were called the
Northern and the Southern Churches.  Although it
was in the north of India that Buddha had preached,
it was there that his rules of life were modified and
made less severe.  The Southern Church observed
them more strictly.
</p>

<p>
In the centuries that followed, the doctrines of
Buddha won converts far beyond India itself&mdash;in
Tibet in the north, in Burma and Siam in the east
and south, and so to the Malay Peninsula and to the
islands of the Malay Archipelago.  Farther west it
was carried down into Ceylon.
</p>

<p>
Whatever, we may think of the religion of Buddha,
it is obvious that it was in no sense a "fighting religion."  It
did not inspire its followers to be soldiers.  Perhaps
this is the reason why the Hindus never seem to have
been able to resist the incursions of warlike neighbours.
In the fourth century B.C.  came Alexander of Macedon
and pushed his wonderful conquests into the very
heart of India.  His general, Seleucus, organised part
of the conquered territory under his rule, but it made
little lasting impression on the story of the country.
About the middle of the second century A.D., the wild
hordes of the Parthians, the people who gave such
continual trouble to the mighty Roman Empire, swept
into Northern India, and with them they brought
Christianity.  Christianity, too, came early to that
Malabar coast where the Portuguese, more than a
thousand years later, found the Moslems in full
possession.  But Christianity was not imposed by force.
</p>

<p>
Although many wars have been fought for
Christianity, it would be no more right to speak of
it, than of Buddhism itself, as a "fighting
religion."  Mahommedanism, on the contrary, has ever been the
great fighting religion of the world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
</p>

<p>
In the eighth century, while the Mahommedans in
the West were making themselves dominant in Spain,
other armies of the same faith went conquering
eastwards through Central Asia to the very borders of
China.  They conquered, but they did not succeed
in establishing any permanent empire.  There was no
power at their centre to control such an extent of
the world's surface.  The local princes became
practically independent again.  But in many parts the
Mahommedan religion remained.  It failed to make
any impression in Tibet, where the Great Llama, as
the chief of the Tibetan Buddhists was called, was
ruler as well as high priest.
</p>

<p>
In India Mahommedanism established itself the
more easily because Buddhism was by that time a
waning force in many parts and was being re-absorbed
by the older Brahmanism.  Spread by its missionaries,
called Mullahs, the new creed won its way right through
the country to Siam, down the Malay Peninsula and
into the islands of the archipelago.  It penetrated
southward also.  We have noted that when the Portuguese
came to the western shores of Southern India in
1500 or so they found Sultans, as the heads of
Mahommedan states were called, in possession.  To these
seaports, however, and to the islands it is likely
enough that the religion of Mahomet was brought
by the Arab traders as much as or more than by any
overland route.
</p>

<p>
Of the principalities which gained, or regained,
independence after the flood of Moslem conquest had
swept from West to East, that which became of
greatest importance in the story was the kingdom of
Afghanistan.  It has been of importance by reason
of its geographical position making it "the gate of
India," as it has been called.  It is the "gate" for
such nations as Persia and Russia which might seek
to enter India from the west and north.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
</p>

<p>
From the kingdom of Afghanistan itself a Moslem
army swept again into India about the year A.D. 1000.
A confederacy of Hindu princes assembled a force to
oppose it, but it is said that this army was entirely
demoralised by the sound&mdash;the first of its kind that they
had heard&mdash;of a gun brought by the invaders.  The
rule of the Moslem Viceroys, under which a large
portion of Northern India was administered as the
result of this Afghan victory, seems to have been
equitable and effective, and in the course of the four
centuries that followed a great part of all India became
Mahommedan.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Timour, the Tartar
</span>
</p>

<p>
At the end of that period appeared on the Indian
scene the formidable figure of Timour, the Tartar,
sometimes known as Tamerlane or Tambourlaine,
meaning Tamer, or Timour, the Lame.  He too was
a Mahommedan, and doubtless was of the same stock
as those Afghan rulers who claimed Turkish descent;
but that distant relationship did not deter him from
the invasion of India from the north.  He won his
way easily enough as far as Delhi, and there appears
no reason why he should not have pushed his conquests
as far south as he wished.  He returned to his own
country, however, and shortly afterwards went
westward against the Ottoman Turks and very heavily
defeated them at Angora, the new capital of modern
Turkey.
</p>

<p>
But for the lack of ships, it seems certain that
Timour, with his Tartar hordes, would have passed
over into Europe&mdash;with what result on our story no
one can say.  But he had no means of crossing the
Dardanelles, and once more he went back to his own
country.
</p>

<p>
Rather more than a thousand years later one of
his descendants again invaded India from the north,
and made a beginning of that Mogul empire which
was to become far more widely and firmly established,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
under the great Akbar, towards the end of the
sixteenth century.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Such, or somewhat such, are the main features of
the stories of that new world in the West and that
old world in the East which were opened up by the
enterprise of Spain and Portugal about the year 1500.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THREE KINGS AND A MONK
</h3>

<p>
Apart from the discovery of the West and of the
new sea-route to the East, the most important events
in the early years of the sixteenth century happened
in Italy&mdash;Northern Italy.  We have seen that Italy
was almost the only country which showed no sign,
as yet, of settling down within something like the
boundaries which delimited the European nations
up to the time of the Great War.  It must be understood
that this is a statement which takes no account
of the differences made by Napoleon's victories at the
beginning of the nineteenth century.  We may
disregard them, for the moment, because they were not
lasting.
</p>

<p>
But the most important of all the events happening
in Italy had nothing to do with changes of territories
or national boundaries.  Far more interesting and
more helpful to the world was the growth of that
Renaissance, or new birth, of love of letters and of all
artistic beauty which we saw beginning with Dante
and Petrarch and Boccaccio, and some of the early
Italian painters, sculptors, and jewellers.  Moreover,
we must not forget the glorious architecture which
goes by the name of Gothic, nor the noble buildings
in that Byzantine style which the influence of the Moors
carried into Spain.
</p>

<p>
We should notice that a very great impetus was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
given to that study of Greek literature, which Petrarch
and Boccaccio in particular had revived, by the capture
of Constantinople by the Turks in the middle of the
fifteenth century; for it had the effect of scattering
the Greeks far and wide, seeking new homes and
bringing their books and their traditions with them.
</p>

<p>
And further, we ought to observe how this learning
had been carried into every country and corner of
Europe by the establishment of colleges and universities
where it now became possible for every student to
read "the classics."  Their establishment was the
work of the Church or of wealthy men acting under
the advice of the Church.  Moreover, for what we
may call elementary education the teaching of the
children of the poorer classes, so far as they received
any teaching at all, was also the Church's work, for it
was done by the members of the monasteries and
convents all over Christendom.  It is well that we
should bear this in mind, to the Church's credit, at
this moment, for the time is close at hand when we
shall have to see that same Church accused, and in
large measure convicted, of acts very greatly to her
discredit.
</p>

<p>
All the while that the love of letters and of art
was growing within the walls of the fortified cities of
Italy, the cities were constantly at variance with one
another, and even within their walls civic strife seems
to have been the rule rather than the exception; but
apart from these small local fights there were two
principal causes of unrest.  The first was the fact that
the kings of France were not at all disposed to regard
the Alps as forming a natural boundary of their
possessions&mdash;they were constantly coveting the fertile
land of Northern Italy&mdash;and a second cause of unrest
was the desire, which was strong enough to unite for
a time most of the other states, to cripple the excessive
power of Venice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The decline of Venice
</span>
</p>

<p>
Several circumstances combined to make possible
the curbing of that power.  The Turks were strong
enough at sea to demand the full attention of the
naval force of Venice, and her resources were vastly
diminished by the diversion of that Eastern trade,
for which she had held the gate into Europe, to the
newly found sea-way round Africa.  The Pope took
the lead against her.  He formed a league which
was joined by the Emperor and by the kings of
France and Spain.  The alliance was too strong for
the single state, and after the first battle Venice
resigned nearly all her possessions on the mainland.
She ceased to be a danger to the neighbouring
states.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, no such combination of
circumstances to diminish the power of France.  Within
a few years after the beginning of the century the
French, by the capture of Genoa, had established
themselves in a strong position to menace the whole
of Italy.  The French king Louis XII. had some
pretext for the menace, for he could produce a kind of
hereditary claim on the sovereignty both of Naples
and of Milan.  He had served the Pope against Venice,
and after rendering this assistance he was not
disposed to withdraw his claims.  The Pope therefore
arranged a new league against his late ally.  Spain,
the Emperor, and England were parties to this, which
was called the Holy League&mdash;England under Henry
VIII., who was not always to prove himself so close
a friend of the Pope!  The result was the speedy
expulsion from Italy of the French, chiefly by the
Spanish armies.  Very shortly afterwards the French
king died and was succeeded on the throne by his
cousin Francis I. in 1515.
</p>

<p>
It has been my aim, through all the course of this
Greatest Story, to encumber it with as few names
as possible, in order that the names of the most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
important actors may stand out the more clearly and
be remembered the more easily.  But just at the
moment which the story has now reached the names
of four men, three being powerful kings and one a
humble cleric, stand out pre-eminently.  We might
almost say that the story of those four is the story of
all Europe, so large is their part in it.
</p>

<p>
Luther is the name of the cleric.  He was the leader
in that great schism, or cleaving off, of the Protestant
Church&mdash;the Church which "protested"&mdash;from the
ancient Church of Rome.  It is that cleaving off from
the old and founding of the new, the reformed, Church,
which is called the Reformation.
</p>

<p>
The three great kings were Francis I. of France,
above mentioned, our own King Henry VIII., and&mdash;by
far the greatest of the three&mdash;Charles V.
</p>

<p>
It was the greatness of Charles V., the accident,
as we may perhaps call it, that he held, in his own
person and by rightful succession, the sovereignty of
so many and extensive countries so far apart from each
other, which was one of the chief factors of the story
at this time.  For he was of the ancient house of the
Habsburgs.  He was the ruler of Austria.  He became
Emperor.  He became King of Spain.  He was Duke
of Brabant and Count of Flanders and Holland.  He
had a claim of sovereignty over Burgundy.  The
Pope purchased his help against the Reformation
movement of Luther by giving up to him such
sovereignty as he was able to enforce over the greater
part of Italy.
</p>

<p>
We can see at once what was the position of France
thus surrounded.  And we must always remember
that it was the day of despotic monarchy, when the
king could make war or peace at his own pleasure
and regarded the lands over which he was king as his
own private property.  Especially of this despotic
kind was the monarchy of Francis.  He appears in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
history as a brilliant figure, ambitious, eager for deeds
of arms, without depth of character or fixed principles.
He came to the throne as a young man and at once
was attracted by the lure of Italy.
</p>

<p>
At first his arms had a rapid success, and he defeated
the combined forces of Spain, the Papal states, and
Venice&mdash;Venice being then in alliance with the Pope.
He was thus victorious over Italy in arms, but the
culture of Italy and of the Renaissance made a
complete conquest of him.  A new combination of Swiss,
German, and Spanish arms drove the French out of
Italy, and Francis returned, strongly influenced by
that new light of art and letters which he had
there found.  From that invasion of Italy by the
French we may date the beginning of the Renaissance
in France, whence it spread to other nations of
Europe.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The "Cloth of Gold"
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was in the year 1516 that Charles succeeded to
the throne of Spain and to the possession of all the
wealth that the Spanish ships had begun to bring in
from the New World.  Three years later he was
elected Emperor, giving offence thereby to Henry VIII. of
England, as well as to Francis, since both had sought
to be Emperor.  Their common cause of offence led
to their famous meeting known as the "Field of the
Cloth of Gold" by reason of the magnificence of the
decorations, the gay and splendid tents, and so on.
But it all ended in nothing, or indeed less than nothing,
except an exchange of compliments, for almost
immediately afterwards we find Henry, under the
influence of the great Cardinal Wolsey, pledged to
support Charles.  In the shifting alliances of the time
it was nearly always against France that England was
engaged, notwithstanding that Henry's sister had
married Francis' predecessor on the throne of France.
Charles, on the other hand, was Henry's nephew.  But
France was constantly giving aid to Scotland, whether
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
secretly or openly, in her continual fight with England.
Scotland, however, had just been beaten to her very
knees in the battle of Flodden, and had little fighting
left in her for the moment.  With such forces as
these opposed to France the wonder really is that she
maintained her power undiminished.  It is yet more
wonderful that, under Francis, she should have been
ready for still further adventures in Italy.  Yet she
did so adventure, and though she and her king met with
grievous disaster there&mdash;especially at the battle of
Pavia where Francis was made prisoner and whence
he was taken to Madrid&mdash;we have to notice that at
the death of Francis, shortly before the middle of the
century, France was in possession of the provinces
of Savoy and Piedmont, both on the Italian side of the
Alps&mdash;and this, although Charles had been crowned
"King of Italy" by the Pope nearly twenty years
earlier.  Probably the explanation lies chiefly in the
fact that the territories over which Charles ruled were
so extensive, and also so scattered, that it was
impossible for him to bring any great force together
at any one place.  Moreover, on his south-eastern
border, in and around Austria, he was constantly
menaced by the Turks ever pressing up from
Constantinople.  He seems to have tried to rid himself
of the Turkish trouble by handing over to his brother
some of the provinces on the side which lay most
dangerously exposed; but even so their defence must
have remained practically on his hands.
</p>

<p>
He never made good his claim to Burgundy&mdash;in
which matter again it is rather wonderful that
Francis should have been able to resist him.  And,
not having Burgundy in his possession, he was
obliged to maintain a fleet able to command the seas
on the west of France in order to go to and fro between
Spain and the Netherlands.  He must also have a
second fleet of ships for bringing treasure from the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
East; and, since Spain had a long sea-coast on the
Mediterranean where the Turks and pirates swarmed,
he must have yet a third fleet there for the protection
of his trade.  Besides, he had a claim of sovereignty
over Naples and Sicily.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, with these, and other less important,
calls upon his power it is really not surprising, great
although that power was, that it did not prove equal
to all he would have liked to demand of it.  And
further, in those states over which he had been elected
Emperor, with the rather vague authority and duties
belonging to that title, another cause arose of great
and increasing trouble, the Reformation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Luther
</span>
</p>

<p>
For the last few pages we have been occupied with
kings and emperors: it is time that our story concerned
itself with the cleric of low degree.  I put this
phrase in place of that which was on my pen's tip to
write, namely, "humble cleric," because, however
we may think of Luther, "humble" he certainly
does not appear.  Humble before God he may indeed,
as a good Christian, have been.  It was perhaps
the most striking feature in his character that he
would not humble himself before men&mdash;not even before
that great man whom he had been taught to look
on as endowed with a quite special grace and blessing,
the Pope of Rome.  His origin was humble enough.
He was the son of a miner in the German state of
Saxony.  He had the education of a monk, was made
Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Wittenberg, in Saxony, and took the degree of Doctor
of Divinity.  He went on a pilgrimage to Rome
and came back grieving sorely over what he saw
there.
</p>

<p>
The way in which the Pope and his council, called
the Curia, had been governing, or misgoverning, the
Church, had given great offence for many years.  The
monasteries and the convents, that is to say, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
establishments of the monks and the nuns, had done
much useful work in acquiring learning and in
educating the people throughout Christendom in
religious and other knowledge.  Many of them were
doing good work still.  But the condition of most of
them appears to have become very bad, both monks
and nuns being lazy, gluttonous, and worse&mdash;setting
the worst possible example to the common people.
They were careful perhaps about the performance
of the religious ceremonies in the churches, but their
religion had little or no influence on the conduct of
their lives.
</p>

<p>
Against Rome itself the complaint of Christendom
was not only that it did not exercise its authority to
amend these ill practices, and that the very same
practices were followed in Rome itself, but also that
the Pope and his council exacted money, from the
people generally and even from the clergy themselves,
and did not apply the money to the purposes for which
it had been demanded.  For the demand was made on
the plea that the money was needed to equip armies
to fight the Turk, and those armies were never
summoned or put in movement.  The money was
diverted to increase the private wealth and pomp of
Pope and Cardinals and high church dignitaries at
Rome.
</p>

<p>
So there was sufficient cause of offence, both at the
centre and in every part of the world over which the
Pope claimed authority.  We saw in the last volume
how our own Wycliffe, and how Huss, in Bohemia,
had raised furious protests against these evils in the
Church.  The fire of those fierce protests was still
smouldering.  The people understood the protests
better.  The knowledge of the Bible was not so
entirely the possession of the clerics as it had been.
The printing press had made many copies.  Moreover,
the Greeks and the knowledge of the Greek language,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
in which the New Testament was written, had been
widely dispersed when the Turks took Constantinople&mdash;the
headquarters of the Greek Church.
</p>

<p>
Luther's first act of protest against the action of
Rome was directed against the sale of "Indulgences,"
as they were called.  These "indulgences" were
written pardons for sin.  They were even credited with
power to bring out of Purgatory a soul that was there
already.  And they&mdash;that is to say, the parchments
or papers with the pardon written on them&mdash;could
be bought.  They could be bought from people
called "pardoners" who sold them on behalf of Rome,
and the Pope's explanation was that the money was
needed for the building at Rome of the Cathedral of
St. Peter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The burning of the "Bull"
</span>
</p>

<p>
Luther boldly declared that the "indulgences"
were valueless, because no man, not even the Pope,
had the power to forgive sins, and he nailed a declaration
to this effect on the door of the great church
at Wittenberg and sent another copy to his Archbishop.
At first the Pope seems to have made light of the
matter; but at length, as Luther's supporters increased
in number, he issued a Bull of excommunication
against Luther as a heretic, summoning him to Rome
to give an account of his actions, and commanding
the burning of books which he had written against
Rome.  We have seen before what such a Bull meant.
It had meant so much in the way of setting a man
outside the protection of the laws in this world, and
in condemning him in the world to come, that even
the great Emperor Frederic had to yield before it,
cowed and vanquished.  The act of the monk of
Wittenberg, when he received it, was to throw it
publicly on the fire kindled for the very purpose in an
open space of the city!
</p>

<p>
The fire created by the burning of the Papal
document set all the smouldering embers into a more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
furious flame than ever before.  That burning of the
Bull happened in 1520.
</p>

<p>
Luther did not go to Rome; but he did go, when
summoned by Charles, the Emperor, and appeared
before him at the Diet, or meeting, of the German
States, held at Worms.  Charles, after listening to
his passionate pleadings, pronounced that he should
receive the treatment of a heretic, but he was allowed
to leave Worms and start for his home.  On the
journey he was taken prisoner by the Elector of Saxony,
who had always been a friend to him.  It is supposed
that this capture was effected for his better protection.
In his imprisonment he made the translation into
German of the New Testament.  Later, he translated
the whole Bible.
</p>

<p>
It is not impossible that this capture was made
with the cognisance of Charles himself.  The course
of events forced him to side with the Pope and oppose
the reformers, but there are several incidents which
show him much more anxious to make peace, if that
were possible, between the two parties, than to take
a leading part in the strife.  He had much to attend
to elsewhere.  In 1526 the Protestant states of
Germany had leagued themselves together for mutual
support; and in the very same year the Turks had
made themselves masters of the whole of Hungary,
and reduced it to a Turkish province.
</p>

<p>
It was now only a year since Charles had released
Francis, whom he had taken prisoner at Pavia, after
making a solemn compact with him; yet Francis
was already intriguing against him.  Francis had
induced the Pope of all people&mdash;the Pope whom
Charles had so helped against Francis&mdash;to be his ally
against Charles.  Charles's reply was to send a strong
force into Italy which sacked Rome and took the
Pope prisoner.  Thus he disposed of that trouble.
He then again made peace with Francis on liberal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
terms.  The Pope was soon set at liberty and returned
to his see, but he seems to have learnt his lesson&mdash;namely,
that Charles held a power far too great to
be opposed, if he cared to put that power forth.
In 1530 Charles was crowned King of Italy by the
Pope and at the same time he received the Pope's
consecration as Emperor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Spread of Reformation
</span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Turks had been extending their
aggressions and besieged Venice.  And the Reformation,
that schism, or cleaving off, which denied the
authority of the Pope, spread more widely and took
deeper root.  Its direction of growth was chiefly
northward, from Saxony which is one of the Southern
German states.  It worked up through Germany
and so to Scandinavia and Denmark, to the Netherlands
and to France.  The help of those German
princes who had formed themselves into a Protestant
league was essential to Charles if he was to be
successful in repelling the Turks, and he consented
to withdraw the edicts condemning the so-called
"heretics" which had been passed by his own
authority.
</p>

<p>
Finally he did march against the Turks, and
though he did not gain any striking victory, a peace
on favourable terms was made with them in 1538,
after their fleet had suffered a heavy defeat from the
Venetians.  For the Turks were constantly at war at
various points of their wide empire.  On the eastern,
the Persian side, there was continual fighting, with
the result that they maintained their hold on Bagdad,
the capital; but it was a possession which they always
had to keep strongly defended.  Their pirate fleets
had established themselves in Tunis and Algiers on
the North African coast.  Charles made two naval
expeditions against them, in the first of which he
succeeded tolerably, but in the second had no success
at all.  The Moslem corsairs remained dominant in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
the Mediterranean until they suffered a notable defeat
in the famous battle of Lepanto in 1571.
</p>

<p>
Luther died in 1546, boldly uttering, both by
speech and writing, his doctrines until the last.  He
lived to see them firmly grounded in Germany, and
spreading north and west.  On the Continent of
Europe the kings were in opposition to them.  In
England, exceptional circumstances arose which
disposed Henry VIII. to receive them with favour.
</p>

<p>
Rather as Francis was attracted by the idea of
adding to his French possessions the northern and
western provinces of Italy, so Henry VIII. was tempted
by the desire to regain for England some of the
continental territory that had once been hers.  It
was largely to this end that he had sought alliance
with Spain and had helped Spain and the Pope in
driving the French out of Italy in 1512.  Later he
had the assistance of the King of Spain in an invasion
of a part of France which had belonged to England in
a former reign.  He gained a quick success, but before
he could establish himself in the conquered province
the Spanish help was withdrawn.  The adventure
gained nothing for England, but cost her a large
sum and created much dissatisfaction among the
people.
</p>

<p>
The idea of the Spanish alliance had been in the
mind of Henry VIII.'s father, before him, and to
confirm it he had married his eldest son to a Spanish
princess, Catherine of Aragon.  That eldest son died,
and left Catherine a widow.  Henry VIII. pursuing
the same policy, sought, and obtained, from the Pope
a "dispensation," as it was called&mdash;that is to say, a
permission&mdash;to marry Catherine, although she was his
brother's widow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Henry VIII. and his Queens
</span>
</p>

<p>
The alliance with Spain did not bring Henry nearly
all that he had hoped of it.  He was disgusted by the
withdrawal from France of the Spanish force that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
we have just noted.  Catherine's children died, with
the exception of a daughter, Mary.  Perhaps his great
minister, Cardinal Wolsey, put it into Henry's head
that there was a curse on his marriage with his brother's
widow, or perhaps it was a thought that came to him
without Wolsey's suggestion.  However it came, it
seems that it took possession of him.  He expressed
doubts about the legality of the marriage.  Also he
had fallen in love with a lady of the Court, Anne
Boleyn.  He began to desire the annulment of his
marriage with Catherine in order that he might marry
Anne Boleyn, and approached the Pope with a request
that he should pronounce that marriage invalid and
illegal.  It was, in effect, asking the head of the
Church, who, in theory, could do no wrong, and was
infallible, to confess that such infallible authority had
erred.
</p>

<p>
The Pope was not at all anxious to make an enemy
of Henry.  In the troubles created by Luther's preaching
and writing, Henry, so late as 1521, had appeared
as a true friend to the Pope by ordering the burning
of all Luther's books.  So the Pope sent great Churchmen
to England to look into the matter of the marriage.
There was much talk and many conferences, but in
the end Henry must have realised, what he probably
had deemed probable from the beginning, that the
Pope would not reverse a former decision.  He could
not get his marriage declared to be illegal by the
Church at Rome.  He determined to act without
that Church, to have the illegality pronounced by
English bishops, whom he could trust to express such
opinions as he should command them to utter, and
to proceed in accordance with their views thus
expressed.  Catherine was divorced.  He married Anne
Boleyn.
</p>

<p>
Once he had taken this step, he followed on the
path to which it led, never looking back.  The proud
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
Cardinal Wolsey fell from the king's favour, largely
by reason of his pride and arrogant ostentation which
had raised him up a number of enemies among the
English nobles, but he was succeeded by another
adviser, Thomas Cromwell, whose influence was even
greater in determining the king to be the absolute
master of England.  Under Wolsey he had gone far
in this direction.  Parliament had power in its hands,
because it had the power of granting subsidies for
the king's wars and expenses.  Wolsey had advised
the king not to summon Parliament, but to extort
contributions from his subjects instead.  They did
not give cheerfully, nor to the full extent of the sums
demanded, but they gave grudgingly, in fear of punishment
for some charge that would be brought against
them if they did not.
</p>

<p>
Under Cromwell's influence, the king did call his
Parliament together; but by that time, with his
growing power, he had succeeded in getting his own
friends in a majority in that Parliament.  And in
order to put down any possible opposition in the
Upper House, he did not hesitate to bring to the
executioner's block some of the noblest and most
venerable of the Peers.  It was a reign of terror, with
Henry as absolute despot.
</p>

<p>
And he made himself despotic in the Church no
less; for that was the final end of that path on which
he made the first step when he divorced Catherine
and married Anne in defiance of Rome.  For first
came thunders, ever louder and louder, from Rome,
answered by ever louder defiance.  It was defiance
that was not displeasing to a large number in England.
Already, before any of the ideas of the Reformation
were introduced, we have noticed England growing
restive under the attempts of the Popes of Rome to
dictate to her.  We may be sure that this restiveness
had been increased of later years.  Some of the clergy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
themselves, as we have seen, were none too pleased
at the demands which Rome made upon them for
money for Turkish wars, or for the building of St. Peter's
Cathedral.  They were the less pleased, because
of a strong suspicion that it never was intended to use
the money for the purposes stated.
</p>

<p>
Henry, therefore, and his powerful and ruthless
counsellor were able to turn this dissatisfaction to
their own use.  The clergy were very ready to support
Henry in asserting that the English Church was not
to be subservient to Rome.  Even the bishops in the
Upper House probably thought that they were doing
a good work for the freedom of the Church when they
passed the Act called the Act of Supremacy which
made the King of England head of the English Church.
That Church was indeed freed, by the Act, from the
authority of Rome, but it was only to put it under
another authority, the authority of the English
king.
</p>

<p>
And it gave equally little offence to the majority
of the clergy when the king drove the monks from
their monasteries, and took their land and its revenues
for the service of the Crown or gave them to his friends.
The good work of the monasteries had been done, and
they had passed the time of their usefulness, for their
inmates no longer studied to acquire knowledge, nor
imparted it to the laity and their children.  Only in
the north of England did their suppression rouse
opposition and lead to a dangerous rising which the
Crown's forces put down with great severity.
</p>

<p>
But education had been spreading in England, as
elsewhere in Christendom, in spite of the religious
troubles.  The new opening of the ancient stores of
classical literature, and their diffusion by the printing
press, could scarcely fail to arouse the interest of men
of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of protest against Rome which Luther
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
preached had this, at least, in common with the spirit
in which Henry of England acted, that both were
bitterly and even violently opposed to the Pope's
claim of authority.  So this spirit of the Reformation
made its way in England without encountering the
difficulties which it had met in other parts of Europe.
The clergy, who, in an earlier reign, would have
opposed it, had now become subject, in part by their
own act, to the King of England rather than to the
Pope of Rome.  Protestantism was accepted as the
State religion.
</p>

<p>
In Ireland also Henry declared himself head of
the Church as well as king.  All Acts of the Irish
Parliament, from his reign for several centuries, had
to receive the assent of England before they became
law.
</p>

<p>
Of the four great men who had so large a share in
the making of our story in the first half of the sixteenth
century, the monk, the most important figure of the
four, was the first to die, in 1546.  The next year saw
the deaths of Francis and of Henry.  Charles, greatest
of the three kings, lived on until 1558, though he laid
down his honours two years or so earlier and retired
to a monastery to end his days.
</p>

<p>
By the death of Francis, Charles was relieved of
his life-long enemy, and took advantage of that relief
to turn all his attention to the Protestant princes of
Germany who were leagued together to support their
faith by arms.  He defeated them at that time, and,
using his victory, as was his custom, with moderation,
he drew up a document called the "Interim," a
statement of doctrines to which he hoped that both
Catholics and Protestants would agree.  It failed,
however, to satisfy either.  Five years later the
Protestant princes again took arms, and this time their
Emperor, whom they found unprepared, had to fly
for his life.  The ultimate result was a treaty called
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
the Peace of Religion, of which the most important
provision was that the Emperor permitted the
Protestants, so far as the permission lay with him to
give, to hold their doctrines and perform their religious
services as they thought right.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Peace of Religion
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful name&mdash;the Peace of Religion&mdash;but
unfortunately the name of peace was not sufficient
to ensure that peace would follow.  Even within
the Protestant Church itself there soon arose acute
differences of opinion.
</p>

<p>
The doctrines of the monk won their way over most
of North-Western Europe.  Into Scandinavia and
Denmark they were introduced with the support
and favour of the king himself.  They made little
penetration on the eastern side, for the simple reason
that those particular abuses against which they
protested did not exist there.  Their protest was
mainly against evil practices in the Church of Rome.
But over Russia, rising into greatness in the east of
Europe, the Greek Church prevailed.  Constantinople,
until its capture by the Turks, had been the capital
city, the Holy Place, of that Church; but now the
Tsar of Russia claimed to be its head, speaking from
his capital city of Moscow.
</p>

<p>
We saw something of the break-up of the Mongol
power, which had extended over nearly the whole of
Asia and threatened Europe also, when we were recounting
the story of China.  The blow that was dealt
it at the end of the fourteenth century by the Buddhist
monk who became the first Emperor of the Ming
Dynasty doubtless helped in its break-up even so far
away as its western border.  The centre of its power
was shattered.  It no longer had the strength that
comes from unity.  The Mongols fell apart into a
number of independent tribes.  Early in the sixteenth
century Russia began to throw off the domination
with which those Mongols, or Tartars, always threatened
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
her, and from time to time exercised.  She had partly
amalgamated with the Tartars, and partly ruled over
them, by the middle of that century.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge of Russia began about the same time
to be brought to England, by traders who had found
their way to Moscow by adventurous voyages round
the top of Scandinavia and so on to the White Sea,
whereon is the city of Archangel, and so down into the
centre and capital of the great country, travelling
partly by river and partly overland.  A treaty, for
the exchange of the products of the two countries,
was made, and the English were allowed to build
warehouses for storing those goods which they brought
in to trade with and those Russian goods which they
obtained in return.
</p>

<p>
It is of interest to note that this discovery of
Muscovy, as Russia for a long while was called in
England, was made by sailors in search of a very
different land, namely, China.  For there was an idea
in the minds of the men of the fifteenth century that
a way to China, and all its riches, might be found by
sea round the top of Scandinavia and so eastward
until China was reached.
</p>

<p>
And so, in fact, some sort of a way was ultimately
found through Behring's Straits&mdash;the narrow sea-way
between the extreme north-east of Asia and the
extreme north-west of America.  But it is a way so
blocked by the ice for so large a part of the year as
to be of no practical use, and the discovery of the
south-west passage round the Cape took all the interest
and zest out of the search for what was called the
North-West Passage.  Portuguese trading vessels had
reached China and Japan before the middle of the
century and missionaries of the Order of Jesus, or
Jesuits, had introduced Christianity into Japan as
they had already brought it to India.  Spanish
missionaries of the same great monastic order had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
carried Christianity westward into the New World.
Thousands of Indians in Mexico and Peru and other
countries conquered by the Spaniards were baptised
as Christians.  Churches and cathedrals built by the
labour of the natives, which cost the Spaniards nothing,
began to rise on the sites of the pagan temples.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cross and Crescent
</span>
</p>

<p>
Thus both eastward and westward the Cross, the
Christian emblem, travelled with the conquering
sword of those who went by sea; but on land, and in
the Mediterranean itself, the Mahommedan Crescent
was carried far by the scimitar, or curved blade, of
the Moslem.
</p>

<p>
The Moslem Turks fought their way, as we have
seen, so far, in Europe, as Vienna, which they nearly,
but not quite, captured.  On the other side they had
subdued Persia, and established themselves at Bagdad.
Up to the year 1571 and the heavy defeat of their
fleet at Lepanto, they continued to be the strongest
naval force in the Mediterranean.  It was in the
first half of the century that they touched the highest
point of their power and extended their sway most
widely.  In further course of the story we shall find
them for the most part on the defensive, striving,
especially against the growing might of Russia, to
retain what they had won.
</p>

<p>
Towards the latter part of his reign that great
king and emperor, Charles V., had trouble in the
most northern section of his wide domain&mdash;in the
Netherlands.  He put down, with severity, a rising
of the great city of Ghent, formidable, within its walls,
because of the privileges that had been granted to
its burghers, because of the wealth and of the numbers
of its inhabitants and their independent spirit.  This
little trouble in the Netherlands might have sounded
in his ears, if they had been able to appreciate its
meaning, as the first note of an immense trouble that
was to follow, for in the years to come we shall find
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
unrest and fighting over almost the whole stage, which
has become world-wide, of our story; and we may
trace the origin of it all back to what now happened
in that comparatively small corner which was called
the Netherlands.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE WANING POWER OF SPAIN
</h3>

<p>
Charles V. resigning the Crown of Spain, gave it
over to his son Philip II., who married Mary, Queen
of England.  He had already ceded to him the
kingdom of Naples.  With the Crown of Spain went the
Netherlands; and Charles would have wished his son
to receive the Imperial title also.  The Electors of
Germany, however, refused to elect Philip and, with
the assent of Charles, Ferdinand, Charles's younger
brother, became the new Emperor.
</p>

<p>
Charles, although a firm supporter of the authority
of the Church of Rome, had done his best, by the
publication of that "Interim" mentioned in the last
chapter, and by a merciful treatment of the defeated
Protestants, to bring the two parties together again.
He failed; but he had made the effort.  The character
of Philip did not dispose him to follow his father in
any attempts at peace-making.  He was ardently
jealous for the ecclesiastical authority of Rome and
appears to have had much of the tyrant's spirit: he
was very impatient of opposition, and showed no
favour to any who differed from him in opinion.
Heresy was, in his view, a sin against the Church,
which it was his duty to put down by the most effective
means in his power, wherever he might find it among
his subjects.  Wherever it was even so much as
suspected, the strictest search should be made for its
unmasking.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
</p>

<p>
And to him, being in this mood, there was a machine
ready to his hand&mdash;an institution of the Church known
as the Inquisition.  Inquisition means inquiry; and
the particular object for which the Inquisition was
instituted was to inquire into alleged instances of
heresy&mdash;that is to say, of doctrines and practices of
which the Church did not approve&mdash;and also into
instances of the practice of magic and sorcery, which
were deemed to be miracles performed by men with
the aid of the devil.
</p>

<p>
The first institution of "Inquisitors," or officials
appointed for such inquiry, dated back to the early
centuries of the Church's existence, and in those early
centuries the punishment which the Inquisitors were
allowed to impose on persons convicted of heresy were
very mild in comparison with later penalties.  They
were not allowed to inflict death, nor to use torture
in order to extract confession.
</p>

<p>
In the time of Philip II., the Inquisition in Spain,
under the name of the Holy Office, became largely
independent of the Church of Rome.  It actually
brought before its Courts bishops of the Church.  And
it shrank from no cruelty of torture inflicted on
suspected persons, in order to make them confess: it
even tortured witnesses, to extract from them the
testimony, true or false, which the Inquisitors desired.
Convicted persons were publicly burnt.  There was
no appeal from its decisions.  An accused person had
scarcely a chance of escaping conviction.  And the
religious zeal of the Inquisitors was quickened by the
circumstance that the estates of the convicted were
confiscated and distributed to the Church, or partly
to the Church and partly to the Crown.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Netherlands in revolt
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is no more than fair to the Church of Rome to
say that though the severity and injustice of the
Inquisition under the Church's direct authority were
harsh enough, they were far less cruel than under
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
the Holy Office of Spain, which became a veritable
terror.  The Netherlanders had largely accepted
reformed doctrines.  They had become Protestant,
that is to say heretics, in the eyes of Philip.  He had
been their sovereign only a few years when he sent his
Inquisitors among them to root the heresy out by
torture, confiscation of estates, and by burning at the
stake.  The natives were brave and stubborn.  They
resisted with armed force.
</p>

<p>
It had all the aspect of a vain, even a ridiculous
resistance&mdash;bound to fail, certain to be punished
with relentless cruelty.  To enforce obedience and
to carry out measures of punishment, Philip sent an
army under command of a general notorious for his
harsh severity, the Duke of Alva.  In such an outlined
sketch as this the details cannot be given of the
extraordinary struggle which the Netherlands, under
that very great leader and statesman, William of
Orange, surnamed the Silent, finally brought to a
successful end against all the might of Spain.  Again
and again their endurance seemed on the point of being
overcome.  Once, at least, they were saved only by
the desperate expedient of breaking chasms in the
raised dykes which protect that low-lying land from
the sea, and allowing the water to flood the country.
They had a small naval force before this struggle
began.  Dutch ships had helped Charles in that
attempt which he made to put down the Mahommedan
pirates of the north coast of Africa.  Now, as the
fight with Spain went on, they added to their fleet.
With but a few ships, they gained a victory, which
meant much to them, over a far larger Spanish fleet.
Some of the Spanish ships captured in that battle
helped to increase their own naval forces.
</p>

<p>
England, under Mary, whom Philip had married
in 1554, naturally would give Holland no help.  She
had, besides, her own religious troubles, for Mary,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
under her husband's direction, was doing all that she
dared to bring England back under the authority of
Rome.  No tribunal with the name of Inquisition or
of Holy Office was established, but the persecution
of Protestants, with torture and burning, went
forward almost as briskly as if there had been.  A small
force came to Holland's help from Germany, at one
moment of the long struggle, but little could be
expected from that country, in which the states were
divided in their sympathies between Rome and the
Reformation.  The attitude of France was uncertain
and varied.  Her natural action would have been to
oppose Spain, as in the days of Francis and Charles,
but she was a Roman Catholic country.  She was
distracted, too, by her own troubles with her own
Protestants, called Huguenots.  The form of
Protestantism which had made its way in France
was somewhat different from that taught by Luther.
It inclined to the doctrines taught by Calvin.  But
Calvin was a reformer as earnest and even more
bitter than Luther himself in opposition to Rome.  It
was what has been called, after him, the Calvinistic
form of Protestantism which prevailed in the Netherlands
also, and, with some modification, in England
and Scotland.  The details of the difference we need
not consider.  The main feature which they had in
common and which so affected this Greatest Story was
their resistance to Rome.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Huguenots
</span>
</p>

<p>
The origin of that name Huguenot, by which the
Protestants in France were known, is doubtful, nor
does it greatly matter.  Beginning in the reign of
Francis, the reformed party in France grew stronger
during the reign of several succeeding kings.  There
were two great families in France at this time, the
Bourbons and the Guises.  The former became leaders
of the Protestants and the latter of the Catholics.
Civil war broke out in 1562.  Elizabeth of England
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
sent troops to help the Huguenots, but the fortune
of the war went against them.  A Catholic League
was formed for their extermination.  A general
massacre of Huguenots on St. Bartholomew's Day, in
1572, has made that day lamentable in the reformed
Church ever since.
</p>

<p>
Still the Protestants held on, in the far west of
France, under the leadership of that Henry of Navarre
who became King of France in 1589.  To bring peace
to his country he formally declared himself a Catholic,
but he so favoured the cause of reform that two years
before the end of the century he passed a famous
measure, the Edict of Nantes, by which the French
Protestants were granted freedom to think and act
as they pleased in all religious matters, without penalty
of any kind.
</p>

<p>
Such being the divisions in France during the
struggle of the Netherlands against Spain, it was not
likely that she would give much assistance to either
side.  Elizabeth sent a small army, which effected
little.  She might perhaps have been more liberal
with her help, but England had her full share of
troubles too.  There was still a large English party
sympathising with Rome.  The change in the State
religion which Elizabeth effected as soon as she
succeeded her half-sister Mary&mdash;the Catholic and the
wife of the King of Spain&mdash;was not easy.  She found
herself with a French war on her hands, a war into
which Philip had persuaded Mary towards the end of
her reign.  Almost its only result had been that
Calais, England's last possession in France, had been
lost to her.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth quickly made peace with France; and
that peace included Scotland also.  We have seen,
and we shall see again, how ready France always was
to embarrass England by taking the side of Scotland
in the constant Scottish and English wars.  Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
made peace with France; but since at this moment
there really were two parties dividing France, it was
not easy to be at peace with both.  Elizabeth, as we
also have seen, so far helped the Bourbons, the
Huguenots, as to send some troops to their aid;
and for that aid Havre, with its fine harbour at the
mouth of the Seine, was handed over to England.  But
the Huguenots were defeated.  Havre was English
only for a very short time.
</p>

<p>
And Catholic France was now again helping Scotland,
favouring the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots,
who married a short-lived French king.  In Scotland
the reformed religion, of Calvin's type, had taken a
hold which was destined to grow firmer as time went
on; but for the present the Catholics were in strength
there too.  Their queen was Catholic.  She was
hardly more than in name a queen, for she was but a
child when she came to the throne, and spent years of
her short life as Elizabeth's prisoner.  Finally she was
executed, most probably by Elizabeth's order, although
it was an order which Elizabeth denied.
</p>

<p>
It was almost wholly by their own stout courage
that the United Provinces, as they were called, of the
Netherlands did at length gain their freedom, and
not only freedom to serve God as they saw fit, but also
freedom from the sovereignty of Spain.  It was a
freedom which was not formally acknowledged till
many years later; but it was practically won in 1579.
These United Provinces were seven in number, of
which one was called Holland: and this Holland
came, after a while, to be the name for the whole.
The seven lay in the north, and were united as a
federation under the rule of William of Orange.  The
southern provinces remained for a while longer under
the power of Spain.
</p>

<p>
Into this new and free State came many of the
reformed religion flying from persecution in their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
own countries.  Holland became populous.  Her
industries developed.  Her foreign trade increased.
She had a large trading fleet.  It ventured into those
waters round the Cape of Good Hope which the
Portuguese claimed as their own.  It disputed with
them the trade of the islands in the Malay Archipelago.
And even here the fighting took on something
of a religious character, for the battle was
between ships of Protestant Holland and of Catholic
Portugal.
</p>

<p>
Exactly the same character pertained to certain
encounters of ships which began to take place more and
more frequently westward of the line which the
Pope's Bull had marked out to divide the sphere of
Portugal from that of Spain&mdash;encounters between the
ships of Elizabeth and of Philip of Spain.  By the
year 1581 that line lost what importance it ever had,
because Philip made good, by force of arms, his
rather doubtful claim to the throne of Portugal.  For
three reigns, lasting over sixty years, the King of Spain
was King of Portugal also, although the smaller
kingdom never lost her national identity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
England's Navy
</span>
</p>

<p>
England had begun to have a considerable fleet.
She had long had necessity for ships of war to protect
her exports, principally of wool, to the Continent.
She was under the necessity of making her fleet stronger
and stronger by reason of the growing strength, just
noted, of the Dutch fleet, which came from all the
ports across the Channel.  And especially she had
need to strengthen it since Philip, whose proposal
of marriage Elizabeth had declined, threatened her
with his Armadas.  Hostility to England had become
a religious duty in his sight.  Elizabeth had been
excommunicated.  The Act of Supremacy, by virtue
of which her father had been declared head of the
Church in England, had been passed again in her
favour, in order to wipe out the measures of reaction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
towards Rome which had marked the reign of Mary.
Ireland had risen in revolt in 1560, and a joint
expedition of Spaniards and Italians landed to aid
the rebels.  They were overwhelmed and destroyed
by one, Raleigh, whom Elizabeth knighted as Sir
Walter.
</p>

<p>
And so, on the English side, and on the side of all
the princes of Europe who professed the reformed
religion, the war against Spain became a religious
war.  To waylay the Spanish treasure-ships from the
Indies was an adventure which appealed to the sailors
of England.  It gratified them to get these treasures
for their own and for their Queen and country, and
moreover it was this wealth, thus robbed from the
conquered Indies, with which the enemies of the
reformed Church built and equipped their ships of war.
So we have Drake and Frobisher and other heroes
adventuring into the Pacific and even sailing round
the world in vessels which seem to us almost ridiculously
small for such great enterprise.  They attacked any
Spanish ship they met, they landed and sacked Spanish
settlements in South America, they even ventured
into the very harbours of Spain herself, to "singe the
King of Spain's beard," as they put it.
</p>

<p>
The King of Spain could not for ever endure these
"singeings" so insulting to his dignity.  In 1588 he
launched, for the destruction of England, the largest
naval force ever seen.  It was that force known to
history as the Great Armada.

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Our country was saved assuredly more by the
storms of heaven than by the valour of even such
splendid fighting seamen as the troublous times had
produced.  Survivors of the vast fleet of Spain, after
a severe hammering by Drake in the Channel,
completely circumnavigated our islands, going eastward
and northward through the Straits of Dover and so
round the north coasts of Scotland and down along
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
the western shores, everywhere losing ships on the
way.  Even now, in such lonely places as some of the
small islands lying to the north of Scotland, are found
evidences of the Spaniards' wreckage.  Only a very
small number of that Grand Armada sailed their
crippled way back into the harbours of Spain.
</p>

<p>
In the years that followed, England then being
allied with Henry IV. of France, her ships were seen
more than once attacking the shipping in the very
harbours of proud Spain.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious, from the position as official head of
the reformed Church in which the Act of Supremacy
had first placed our Henry VIII., and had then
confirmed, in a position of scarcely less authority, his
daughter Elizabeth, that the form which Protestantism
took in England, as the State religion, differed from
its forms elsewhere.  On the Continent, none of the
rulers of the States that had adopted the doctrines
of Luther or of Calvin had thought of claiming such
a position.  In England under Henry and under
Elizabeth it must have seemed that, while protesting
against the authority of the Pope over the Church,
Englishmen acquiesced in a like authority vested in the
Crown.  It was a transfer of allegiance.  But Luther,
and yet more so Calvin, would have bitterly resented
that the Church should be under any authority except
that of her own choosing.  Moreover, the English
Protestants retained many of the ceremonies and
services, and performed many of the rites, of the
Church of Rome.  Calvin's ideal of worship was that
it should consist in the simplest and most direct
communication of man with God, with no aids of
beautiful music and rich colour and other appeal to
the emotions, such as the Romans used.  All this he
specially hated.  The rules of life among pious followers
of Calvin were extremely strict.  Austere behaviour
and a serious expression of countenance were rigidly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
demanded of them.  They regarded even the most
innocent amusement as contrary to the spirit of their
religion.
</p>

<p>
This is perhaps a difference which it would be out
of place, in a story sketched in mere outlines, to
mention even at such short length as this, were it not
that it was a difference which had serious consequences
in the reigns of those Scottish kings who succeeded
Elizabeth on the throne of England.  How that came
about was thus:
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Puritans
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the reign of Mary, the Roman Catholic queen,
very many English Protestants had fled abroad.  They
had gone to lands where the Calvinistic doctrines
were followed.  Under Elizabeth they ventured back
into their native land; and the form of Protestantism
that they found there was a shock to them.  They
could not range themselves as members of a Church
that had practices which they detested.  They
formed themselves into a separate sect under the name
of Puritans.  At once they found themselves in
opposition to, not in conformity with (and were
therefore sometimes spoken of as Non-conformists), the
national Church.  They were subjected to
persecution even by a Protestant Government.  From
denying the authority of the Crown as head of the
Church, it was not a very long step to denying the
authority of the Crown in other, less spiritual, matters.
And it was this denial that led to Oliver Cromwell's
Commonwealth, to the cutting off of Charles I.'s head,
to the sailing of the Pilgrim Fathers to America, and
all that was to follow therefrom.  Surely we are
justified in finding a space to note a difference of
opinion in which such astonishing things had their
beginning.
</p>

<p>
During Elizabeth's reign our country was reduced
to its insular boundaries, and yet never before does
there seem to have been a time when England was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
so aware of her greatness as she was under Elizabeth.
Never, moreover, was there such a splendour of
English literary achievement, from the plays of
Shakespeare downward.
</p>

<p>
The truth is that she really was doing a very great
work, though probably Englishmen of that day only
dimly realised what that work was.  She, with the
Dutch and other Protestant States, was gradually
wearing down the greatness of Spain, and all that
Spain stood for.
</p>

<p>
What Spain stood for was despotic power in Church
and State.  Our Henry and Elizabeth were despotic
in both, but the Stuart kings who succeeded them
were not made of the right human stuff for despots,
and both Church and State won freedom under them.
Spain's power suffered a gradual but constant
diminution.  She was fighting on all sides&mdash;constantly
struggling with France or Italy.
</p>

<p>
And Elizabeth's seamen kept harrying her in every
quarter of the Atlantic and even in the far Pacific,
The English Colony of Newfoundland was established.
Elizabeth had relations as far east and south as Persia,
as far east and north as Muscovy, where Russia was
gradually consolidating herself.
</p>

<p>
Russia gained an important victory over the Turks
in 1569.  Moscow, her capital, was indeed burnt by
invading Mongols as late as 1571, but in the year
following the conquerors were themselves defeated.
The other Slav State, Poland, gained a great accession
of strength by absorbing the large territories of
Livonia and Lithuania.  During the sixteenth century
we do not find the Scandinavian nations taking much
direct part in the big story, but in 1587 the King of
Sweden was King of Poland also.  The general tendency
of affairs in that part of the world's stage, however,
was for those two, Poland and Russia, to be forming
themselves into two strong nations of Slav people,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
on the eastern border of the Teutonic people of
Germany.  That is an element in the story to be borne
in mind.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Affairs in the East
</span>
</p>

<p>
Farther eastward again, Russia was extending her
power in Siberia and working out towards that China
of which there is still little story to tell, because, of
all nations of the world, she has ever changed least
and most slowly.  The day had not yet come for
Russia's reaching southward towards Constantinople
on the one side or towards India on the other.  The
Turk was as yet so strong that she had to fight hard
to keep him out of her own borders.  She was still
on the defensive in that south-western corner of her
empire.
</p>

<p>
But India had to suffer invasion nevertheless in
this sixteenth century by a people coming down from
Afghanistan and the north.  They were Mongols,
usually given the name of Moguls.  They were
a Mahommedan people, and under the reign of the
Grand Mogul, Akbar, which covered nearly all the
latter half of the century, they were continually
extending their rule over the Hindus.  It is in this
Mahommedan invasion that we see the real beginning
of that division and opposition in India of Hindus
and Mahommedans which has played a large part in
the story of that country ever since, and which is a
principal cause of her troubles even to-day.  There
were Moslems in India before the coming of the
so-called Moguls, but not in anything like the same
force or number.
</p>

<p>
On the eastern side of Afghanistan lay Persia, and
beyond Persia, to the west again, began the Turkish
Empire.  Between the Persians and these Ottoman
Turks&mdash;Mahommedans both, but belonging to different
sects&mdash;fighting went on with little pause, and with
no result of any long duration.  Persia's position was
difficult, for on the eastern border she was always
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
subject to attack from the Moguls.  That she kept
her independence is due in part doubtless to the valour
of her soldiers, but also, in large part, to the
engagements of the Moguls with India and of the Turks
with their European neighbours on land and sea.
Even the heavy defeat of the Turkish navy at Lepanto
by no means put an end to their activities in the
Mediterranean.  In 1573, two years after that battle,
they lost Tunis; but were still strong enough to regain
that valuable port the very next year.

CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE WARS OF RELIGION
</h3>

<p>
Elizabeth died in 1603, and there was no descendant
of Henry VIII. to inherit the throne.  But Henry VII.'s
daughter had married the King of Scotland, and a
grandson of Henry VII. now held the Scottish Crown
with the title of James VI.  On the death of Elizabeth
he became rightful hereditary King of England also,
with the title of James I.
</p>

<p>
And now it might indeed seem as if the United
Kingdom was about to enter upon years of peace and
glory.  Elizabeth's prudence and the valour of her
seamen had won her military fame.  Her alliance was
sought by princes as far off as the Tsar of Russia and
the Sophy, as the ruler was called, of Persia.  She had
possessions in India, far away in the East, in America
far in the West.  For the first time in her story she
had Scotland as a second self, instead of a constant
enemy on her very border.  Ireland appeared to be
subjugated.  And she had no possessions on the
Continent to draw her into troubles with France.
</p>

<p>
This hopeful prospect was soon clouded over owing,
in large measure, to the folly of the Stuart kings, as
that dynasty was called of which the Scottish James
was the first.  And yet, if it had not been for their
folly, and also for their weakness, it is possible that
England might have had to suffer even greater trials
than did befall her, by reason of the despotic power
which had been won for the Crown by Henry VIII,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
and his great ministers Wolsey and Cromwell.  But
before that power could be broken, and the people
could regain the rights that legally were theirs under
the provisions of Magna Carta, the country had to
suffer miserably through civil war and one of the kings
had to lose his head on the executioner's block.
</p>

<p>
James I. tried to govern as Henry VIII. had
governed before him, that is to say, he tried to govern
without summoning a Parliament.  Legally it was
Parliament only that could vote the money that the
king required to carry on the government.  James
tried to extort this money by what were politely called
"loans."  If those from whom they were demanded
paid the required contributions, well and good.  If
they refused to pay, the Crown had sufficient power to
misuse the processes of the law so as to punish them
for their refusal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The "middle class"
</span>
</p>

<p>
Henry had been able to govern despotically because
the power of the nobles had been so reduced by the
Wars of the Roses, and because he did not hesitate
to reduce their power still further by executing all
who withstood him.  But by the time we come to the
seventeenth century and the Stuart kings we find a
change in the composition of the nation.  It is a
change which had been in progress elsewhere in Europe.
It was that change by which what was soon to be called
the "middle class" came into existence.
</p>

<p>
We saw it beginning first, where all modern culture
had its first beginning and rebirth (renaissance) in
the cities of Italy.  It was the change occasioned by
the growing habit of men to live in towns and cities,
in larger collections, no longer so scattered.  After
the cities of Italy, we saw that the cities of the
Netherlands came to be strong and to acquire much
independence.  In our own land London was, from a very early
day, the chief city.  Its power was the greater because
it had, like the Continental cities, its trained bands,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
its citizens who were more or less trained as soldiers,
ready to fight for the city liberties under the lead of
the Lord Mayor as the chief citizen.  Our country
never produced quite such important citizens of this
class as the Doges, as the rulers of Venice were called,
or the Medici, the great bankers, the merchant princes,
of Florence, and others.  We may class our Lord Mayor
more nearly with the Burgomasters of the
semi-independent cities of the Netherlands.  True, he
never either had or claimed an independence equal
to theirs at the time of their greatest power: but that
was a power which became much diminished during
the struggles of the Reformation period.
</p>

<p>
It is worth notice that many words in our language
indicate how the dwellers in cities and towns seem to
have been considered as necessarily superior in culture
and civilisation to the countrymen.  The very word
"civilisation" itself is from "civis," a citizen, one
who lives in a city.  The man of "urbane" or "polite"
manners is the man who lives in an "urbs," which is
Latin for "town," or πόλις, which is Greek for "city."
</p>

<p>
Thus there grew everywhere a force of this kind, a
force of burghers or townsfolk, a middle class, which
increased in power as the numbers of townsmen and
their riches increased.  In England the people, as
against the king, had an advantage which the people of
Continental countries had not, in their legal right to
send representatives to Parliament before contributing
to the expense of government.  The right existed, even
while they were not able to enforce it.  And with the
growth of this new power of the middle class they
began to have greater power for its enforcement, or,
at least, greater power to resist the punishments which
the king had tried to impose on those who refused to
supply him with money which had not been legally
voted for his use.
</p>

<p>
The Tudors, for all their masterfulness, had been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
more prudent than the Stuarts proved themselves.
Even Henry VIII., in Wolsey's time, had consented
to take only one-half of the sum which he had demanded
as a contribution from the people.  And we may often
see that these Tudors, although they dealt so despotically
with their nobility, appear to have kept a finger,
as it were, on the pulse of the nation, and to have
known how to give way when that pulse beat too
forcibly in opposition.  Perhaps it takes a strong
character to yield, on occasion.  Certainly the Tudors
had what we should call strong characters, and they
knew how to yield.  The Stuarts had less strength,
and they brought the country into cruel trouble by
their inability to yield.  Rather, perhaps, we should
say, they yielded when they should have stood firm,
and stood firm when they should have yielded.  Had
they yielded more discreetly the people would have had
to wait longer for their freedom, though it is possible
they might have won it by less painful means.
</p>

<p>
And although James's prospects looked so fair
when he came to the throne of England, he yet came
to a troubled inheritance.  There was all that trouble
between the State Church and the Puritans, a trouble
which grew greater and which perhaps the Scottish
element that James brought down to England with
him increased.  The Scottish element, if it were not
Roman Catholic in religion, was mainly of the extreme
Puritan type.
</p>

<p>
There was this double source of trouble, therefore&mdash;the
king's illegal endeavour to govern and to extort
supplies of money without a Parliament, and the
increasing tension between the persecuted Puritan party
and the party of the State Church.  Both Puritans
and Catholics had already suffered some persecution
under Elizabeth, and under James these persecutions
became more severe.  It was only a year or two
after his accession that the Gunpowder Plot was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
discovered&mdash;a plot contrived by the Catholics to blow
up the Houses of Parliament and all the legislators
therein.  After this discovery, the persecution of the
Catholics became more severe than ever.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Stuart Kings
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Puritans did not attempt any desperate
measures of the kind, but we have seen that the very
spirit of the whole Protestant movement was a critical
spirit, a spirit of judging, of forming an opinion and not
merely accepting the opinion of some one else, even if
that some one were the Pope himself.  We have seen
how difficult it was for those English Protestants who
had been abroad to accept the conditions which they
found when they returned to England&mdash;the king
occupying a position in the Church not very different
from that which the Pope claimed.  They were very
apt, then, to be critical in matters of government as
well as in matters of religion.  And the actions of James,
and of all the Stuart kings, were of a kind to provoke
a great deal of criticism.  The feeling throughout
England began to be very strong against the Crown.
It was tension, strained feeling, between a large section
of the nation&mdash;a section that began to be more powerful
with that growing power, which we have noticed,
of the middle class&mdash;and the king who was the head
of the State Church.
</p>

<p>
On the Continent there was tension quite as acute
between the people and the princes, but there it was
tension not so much between any two sections of the
reformed Church, as between the people as members
of the reformed Church and the princes as representatives
of the old Church.  Moreover in some lands the
princes and rulers themselves were of the reformed
religion.
</p>

<p>
In France it is the Catholic Crown and the State
forces that we see opposed to the Protestants, there
called Huguenots.
</p>

<p>
In Germany a Catholic League is made by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
rulers of the States that adhered to the old faith, and,
in opposition, a Protestant Union is formed by the
princes of the States that have accepted the doctrines
of the Reformation.  But also in Germany, we see
that, in one of the States at least, a Catholic prince
is set against a large Protestant section of his people.
This was in Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
It was in France that the first violent outbreak,
due to this tension, occurred&mdash;a rising of the Huguenots
under the great Prince Condé.  It was quickly
suppressed, and Condé was taken and imprisoned.  That
was a rising of very small and unimportant character
compared to one which happened three years later,
in 1618, as a consequence of the opposition which we
have just noted, between the king and people in
Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
Bohemia was the land of Huss, one of the fore-runners
of Luther's Reformation.  The spirit of
Protestantism was strong there.  By attempting to
persecute the Bohemians for their religious opinions
and practices the king at once made that spirit stronger
still, and the people appealed for support to the
German princes of the Protestant Union.  It was
support, energetically given.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Gustavus Adolphus
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Bohemian king, on his side, had the help of
the German rulers of States in the Catholic League
and also the promised help of France and of Spain.
James of England was appealed to, but declined.
He was very fully occupied at home.  But we see a
new figure appearing on the stage, a figure of most
attractive and romantic interest&mdash;that of Gustavus
Adolphus, King of Sweden.
</p>

<p>
Sweden, and all Scandinavia, by which I mean
Norway and Denmark also, have not come very
prominently on the stage of the Great Story.  Nor
will they be there now for a very long period at a time.
But at least twice we shall see a Swedish king appearing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
in a dramatic fashion.  Little Denmark is also the
occasional scene of a great event.  One of these
occasions arrived very soon after the date which we have
now reached.  That date is 1618, the year of the
commencement of what is known as the Thirty Years'
War.  The principal leader of the Protestant forces
in that war was Gustavus Adolphus coming down from
Sweden at the head of his armies at a moment when
his help was sorely needed.
</p>

<p>
It was not the first time that he had made himself
known and felt in the affairs of Central and Eastern
Europe.  About the year 1611, when he came to the
throne of Sweden, a design was formed of uniting
Sweden with Russia.  The throne of Russia was the
object of much dispute at the moment.  The year
before, the Poles had invaded Russia, had taken
Moscow, and the son of the Polish king had been
crowned Tsar.  In the year of Gustavus's accession as
King of Sweden, the Poles were driven out of Moscow
again.  We should remember that the first rulers of
Russia, those under whom she had begun to be a
nation, came from Sweden, and since there was no
very apparent heir to the throne it might have seemed
to the Muscovites not unnatural that a Swede should
step into it.  In the end, quite a different solution of
the question was arrived at.  A Tsar of the family
of Romanoff, very distantly connected with the original
sovereign family, was put on the throne, and founded
the dynasty which endured until the last Tsar was
deposed and done to death in the terrible revolution
which happened during the Great War.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible here to pursue all the ups and
downs of the fighting which went on in Germany, for
Germany provided the principal battle-fields through
that war of thirty years' duration.  Knowing what
we do of modern warfare, it may seem difficult for us
to understand how the people of the countries that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
were the scene of such prolonged fighting could survive
at all.  But we have to understand that the way in
which wars were fought in those days was very different
from the present manner.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Thirty Years' War
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the first place, the numbers of the fighters on
either side was small&mdash;ridiculously small, we may
think.  The total population of the countries was
nothing like as dense as it is now.  But even in
proportion to that lesser population, the fighting forces
were small.  In the recent Great War we saw "nations
in arms," as has been truly said.  Every man who
could possibly be spared from the peace work that had
to be continued if people were to have food to eat
and other bare necessities of life, was pressed into the
fighting.  In those older wars only a very few of the
population fought.  The rest might go on with their
ordinary work, for the most part of an agricultural
kind, so long as their land was lucky enough not to
be the scene of the fighting.
</p>

<p>
And the troops moved slowly, so that the campaign
was restricted to comparatively small spaces.  In the
winter there was little or no fighting.  The soldiers
went into "winter quarters."  Probably this was
largely because the roads were so bad and the country
was so undrained and marshy, that it was almost
impossible for them to move about with any artillery
and baggage horses.
</p>

<p>
Generally they went into the towns for their
winter quarters.  And if these towns had walls round
them, as in those days many had, they were tolerably
secure within the walls, so long as they had collected
enough provisions, because there was no artillery
powerful enough to batter down a strongly built wall.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless the misery caused by the perpetual
fighting, and the coming and going of armies during
so many years, was very great, even so.  It is said that
in the principal areas ravaged by the war the population
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
was reduced to one-third of what it had been
before.  But a consideration of the leisurely way in
which the fighting was conducted, and the small
number engaged in it, helps us to realise how the people
of the countries were able to endure it at all.  It also
helps us to understand how it was that it took so long
to bring the war to a conclusion.
</p>

<p>
The Protestant King of Denmark took the lead
of the Union at the beginning of the long struggle, and
at first the Protestants suffered many defeats.  The
great leader of the Catholics, Wallenstein, overran
Denmark itself.  The outlook for the Protestant
cause was as black as it well could be.  At this darkest
moment Gustavus Adolphus came with his Swedes
from the north, and the Catholics were driven back.
Within a few years he was invading Germany, and in
1632 he fought the very important battle of Lutzen,
in which the Protestant forces were completely
victorious.  But it was a victory dearly bought, for
Gustavus himself was killed in the battle and the
Protestant cause found no other leader of equal
ability.
</p>

<p>
The war dragged on.  Spain and France had come
in as members of the Catholic League, against the
Protestants, but now there arose in France a new
policy which set these two Catholic nations in opposition
to each other.  It is an opposition that is closely
associated with the name of one man, the French
king's great minister, Richelieu.
</p>

<p>
We may note here one of the minor results of the
Reformation.  Previously to the Reformation we find
great ecclesiastics, that is to say, men holding the
highest positions in the Church, as great ministers of
the State also.  Our Cardinal Wolsey is an instance.
Indeed you will scarcely find an instance anywhere
of a great minister who was not a high ecclesiastic.
The reason is simple: they were the men who had the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
education, and nearly the only men.  But now many
laymen were beginning to be men of learning also,
and in most of the Protestant countries the State
and the Church were not nearly so closely associated
together as they still were in the Roman Catholic
countries.  Therefore we now begin to see that, whereas
in the Catholic countries the chief ministers of State
continue to be cardinals and great men of the Church,
in the Protestant countries it is so no longer.  The
king's ministers are most often laymen.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Richelieu's policy
</span>
</p>

<p>
During part of the Thirty Years' War the great
French cardinal, Richelieu, had on his hands a heavy
task in suppressing a most formidable rising of the
Huguenots, whose greatest strength was in the west.
England sent a fleet to their assistance, but it effected
little.  They were compelled to yield, after very
brave resistance, and in 1629 was arranged that Peace
of Alais, which is noted in history as marking "the
end of religious wars."  Under that treaty the Huguenots
were given equal political rights in France with
the Catholics.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless in Germany the Thirty Years' War,
which certainly had its rise as a war about religion,
dragged on for nearly a score of years longer, until
its final settlement by the Treaty of Westphalia in
1648.
</p>

<p>
The terms of that treaty might have been less
favourable to the Protestants than they were had the
two great Catholic nations of France and Spain been
in accord.  They had fallen, however, as we have
seen, into bitter opposition, which broke out into active
war.  The real occasion of the war was, as before,
the too masterful power which was held in a single
hand owing to the accident that the Habsburg family,
which governed in Austria, wore the Crown of Spain
also.  It still possessed those Southern States of the
Netherlands which had not won their independence,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
and it had the Duchy of Milan in Northern Italy as
well as Naples in Southern Italy.  The Habsburgs
still surrounded France.  Richelieu's aim was to break
this circle.  He was ruthless and subtle, and he was
single-minded in his determination to make his king
not only the despotic ruler of his own country but
also powerful throughout Europe.  The French
monarch was served by his minister as effectively as
our Henry VIII. by Wolsey and by Thomas Cromwell.
Richelieu had put down a rising of the nobles against
the Crown with severity as cruel as that of Henry's
last, and worst, minister.  The people of France had
never secured the rights which the law gave them in
England&mdash;though the Tudor kings paid those rights
little respect&mdash;and they gave the nobles no support.
In his first aim the great cardinal succeeded.  The
king became despotic in France.
</p>

<p>
His position in Europe, with so powerful an
opponent in the field as the King of Spain, was not so
easily secured.  It was a curious twist of policy which
brought France to the assistance of the Protestant
Union in the later years of the Thirty Years'
War&mdash;France, a Catholic State and under the influence of
a cardinal of the Catholic Church, aiding Protestants
against Catholics!  And it was the aid of France
which saved them, notwithstanding that the French
armies twice suffered defeat in Germany.
</p>

<p>
Of course the motive that brought France in on
the Protestant side was the opportunity of opposing
Spain.
</p>

<p>
The Treaty of Westphalia, which really marked the
end of the religious wars much more definitely than the
Peace of Alais, gave France an extension of territory
on her eastern border, at the cost of Germany.  It
gave Sweden compensation in money and in a fortress
or two on the Baltic for what she had done in the war.
Switzerland had borne a share in the fighting on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
Protestant side, and her independence was recognised
by the treaty; and Holland, which had been practically
a free country for years, was now formally
declared to owe no dependence either to Spain or to
the Emperor.  The Emperor's power indeed, for a
long while vague and declining, was now diminished
to almost nothing.
</p>

<p>
But though Holland stood thus finally free, we
have to remember that there still were what were
called "the Spanish Netherlands," a district, under
the rule of Spain, not very different in its boundaries
from modern Belgium.  In these Spanish Netherlands
fighting between France and Spain continued, in spite
of the Treaty of Westphalia.  They met each other
too in Italy, and the war lingered on with changing
results for more than ten years.  In Germany the
Protestants had gained religious freedom under the
Treaty of Westphalia, and the German princes of both
Protestant and Catholic faiths had been freed from
the rather uncertain bond of union in which they had
been held by the Emperor.  Thus disunited, they had
little power, and the power of France became greater
by their weakness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mazarin's policy
</span>
</p>

<p>
Richelieu died in 1642 and another great
churchman, Cardinal Mazarin, became the king's chief
minister in his place.  But in the following year died
also that king whom Richelieu had served faithfully,
ably, and unscrupulously.  He was succeeded by
Louis XIV., the monarch whose Court was so splendid,
with himself as the centre of its glory, that he is known
as Le Roi Soleil&mdash;the Sun King.  He was a child of
four when he came to the throne.  The regent was
his mother, and since she was a daughter of Philip II. a
reversal of the policy of Richelieu was expected from
her.  To the grievous disappointment of a large party
in France itself and also in Spain and Austria, she
put herself into the hands of Mazarin; and he was a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
faithful follower of Richelieu.  The war with Spain
continued.  But in the very year of the signing of the
Treaty of Westphalia there broke out in France that
uprising of the nobles and of the people which is called
the "Fronde."  It had a remarkable success at first;
though a success which did not endure.  Under the
captaincy of the great Prince Condé, who had led
an earlier rising of the nobles against the Crown and,
before that, had taken a leading part on the Huguenots'
side, Mazarin was driven from Paris.
</p>

<p>
The strength of the two parties was so evenly
divided, however, that in this very same year Condé
himself and a number of his adherents were put
under arrest.  Within three years from the middle of
the century the Queen Mother, with Mazarin as her
minister, was re-established in power and the old lines
of policy were pursued, both at home and abroad.
</p>

<p>
Our England, as we have seen, played little direct
part in the long drawn-out war between the Protestants
and Catholics on the Continent.  Neither did she
directly take any large part in the European contest
between the two great Catholic powers.  She did,
nevertheless, come into touch and into opposition
with both France and Spain abroad.
</p>

<p>
The predominance of Portugal in the East had been
finally broken.  French, Dutch, and English all had
sailed round the Cape and formed settlements in India
and the Malay Archipelago, disputing with Spain and
Portugal the trade of the East.  In the West, in the
New World, Spain for the most part was content to
develop, in such peace as the English seamen would
grant her, her empire in Mexico and South America.
The occupation of Bermuda and of Barbadoes by the
English was accomplished without as much opposition
from Spain as we should expect to find, and Sir
Walter Raleigh's settlement of Virginia, named after
the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth, was achieved without
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
fighting except against the native Red Indians,
was from this expedition that Sir Walter has the credit
of introducing into England potatoes and tobacco.
</p>

<p>
Even before the beginning of the century we have
seen the settlement of England's first Colony,
Newfoundland, and it was in the first years of the
seventeenth century that a trading port was established on
the St. Lawrence river, soon to grow into the city of
Quebec.
</p>

<p>
Spaniards had settled along the coast of what now
is Florida, England had planted the colony which
commemorates the Virgin Queen; and southward of
Virginia lies a state still named after Louis, King of
France&mdash;Louisiana.  At that time it formed but a small
part of a far larger territory so-called and claimed as
a French possession.  England and France, however,
did not come to blows in this part of the newly found
great continent, but they did fall to fighting over their
settlements on the shore of the St. Lawrence.  In the
meantime settlers from England had formed a colony
in what was called New England, between the
St. Lawrence in the north and Virginia southward.
Among these were the colonists who received the name
of the Pilgrim Fathers&mdash;pilgrims flying from England
for their religion's sake, to become the fathers of an
important part of the great American nation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Religious differences
</span>
</p>

<p>
We may pay a little further attention now to the
reasons that induced them to go this pilgrimage.
Their principal motive was to escape persecution on
account of their religion.  That desire led to several
pilgrimages and movements of people of the same
kind in course of the story.  It was a similar motive,
for instance, which made many of the Huguenots come
to England and other foreign lands.  Some went to
Canada, where they encountered, as we have said,
the English on the St. Lawrence.  To understand the
violent intolerance of any differences of religious belief
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
and practice which produced these movements, we
have to understand the way in which the men of that
date viewed those differences.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, looking at it from the Protestant
side, the Protestants felt very bitterly the evil conduct
which they saw in the establishments of the Church.
They protested against these evils, and also against
the authority claimed by the Pope.  The Puritans
in England, for nearly the same reasons, were in
protest against what we may call the High Church
Protestants and against the authority claimed by the
Crown as head of that Church.
</p>

<p>
On the Catholic side, the Pope and all the
authorities were naturally incensed against any who
protested against his authority, because it was essentially
part of his claim, as Pope, that he was infallible, that
he could do no wrong, and that therefore it was a sin
to protest against anything he might choose to do or
affirm.  And inevitably, since he was spiritual ruler
of the Catholic kings, he used his immense influence to
induce them to put down this defiance of his authority
by their subjects.
</p>

<p>
Then that spirit of inquiry and of protest, which
was directed first against the Pope and his commands,
very easily led men into criticism of the authority
of the kings themselves and into protest against their
actions: and this was a kind of protest which was
not at all agreeable to the despotic kings of that day.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we should note this point most particularly&mdash;that
men had lately begun to read for themselves,
for the first time, the Bible, and that in the Old
Testament they found that the Lord punished Israel
and Judah&mdash;whole nations at a time&mdash;because certain
sections of those nations deviated from His true service.
Thence they derived the conviction that if any section
of a modern nation deviated and went astray from
the practice of the true religion, that nation as a whole
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
was liable to divine punishment.  We must get that
conviction of theirs into our minds, and see all that is
implied by it, if we would understand how it was
that they were so fiercely intolerant of these religious
differences.  It explains a great deal of what is
otherwise obscure and difficult about persecution done in
the name of religion.  It explains why the nations
were so ready to send out of their midst any section
that so differed from the majority in their religious
beliefs: and it explains also why these sections were
so very willing to go.  The English Puritans who went
to America, both at the time of the Pilgrim Fathers
in 1620, and again later, must have felt that they were
getting away from the society of wicked men in whose
punishment they might expect to be included; and
similarly the rest of the nation would be only too
pleased to see them go&mdash;for the same reason, that the
majority feared lest the wrath of Heaven should fall
upon the whole mass of the people, because of the
wickedness (that is to say, of the difference of religious
belief and practice which they looked upon as
wickedness) of this small section.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cavaliers and Puritans
</span>
</p>

<p>
Ten years later than the expedition of the Pilgrim
Fathers, that is to say, in 1630, there was a further
large emigration of Puritans from Old England into
New England.  Under Charles I. who had succeeded
James, and tried to pursue the same policy of governing
and extorting money without a Parliament, the
strained feeling between the Crown and the people
grew more intense.  They formed themselves into
distinct parties&mdash;Royalists or Cavaliers on the
outside, and Puritans on the other.
</p>

<p>
The smouldering hostility broke into open war.
In the first battles the Royalists had the advantage.
The Puritan armies were raw and badly organised.
But in their ranks were men of ability and of stern
purpose.  Under the orders of Oliver Cromwell as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
their commander-in-chief a rigid discipline was imposed.
They went into battle singing hymns, inspired by an
intense conviction that they were fighting in the
service of the Lord.  It was a union of discipline with
zeal which the light-hearted and light-headed Cavaliers
could not match.
</p>

<p>
The Royalists wore gallant and gay attire and
flowing curls, and culled all the joys of life.  The
Puritans dressed themselves in sombre colours, set
their faces into solemn lines and regarded even
innocent mirth and amusement as a sin.  The earnestness
which marked all their behaviour they brought
to the business of fighting.
</p>

<p>
After the fortunes of the war had gone variously
in several campaigns, the Royalists suffered what
really was a decisive defeat in the battle of Naseby in
1645.  Their cause never recovered from it.
</p>

<p>
There was quartered in the north of England at
this time a Scottish army.  Charles had endeavoured
to impose on the Church of Scotland the form of
Protestantism which was the State religion in England.
But the majority of the Scottish people professed
a religion much more nearly akin to that of the English
Puritans.  They bound themselves by a Covenant
(whence its adherents were called Covenanters) to
oppose by all means in their power the priests and the
bishops whom the Scottish king of the United Kingdom
tried to force on them.  They took arms and made
their way victoriously south until they were bribed
to stop and to establish themselves in quarters in the
north of England by part payment and part promise
of payment of a yearly sum.  And to the protection
of that army Charles fled, as his fortunes grew more
and more desperate, after the defeat at Naseby in 1646.
The payments promised to the Scots were much in
arrears.  After long negotiations they gave up their
king into the hands of the English Puritans in exchange
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
for a large sum of money to quit the debt.  Once the
king escaped, but was recaptured, and in 1649, after
a trial in which the verdict was certain from the first,
was executed on the block.
</p>

<p>
The king being dead, the Parliament declared the
country a Commonwealth, under Oliver Cromwell,
who had the title of Protector.  The Protector's
powers were not strictly defined, and perhaps there
was no real limit to them, seeing that he had the
army, which was all-powerful, ready to do his bidding.
And this was a power which he had proved that he
would not hesitate to use.  He was a man typical
of the Puritan spirit&mdash;absolutely convinced of the
justice of his cause and determined to make it prevail
no matter at what cost of suffering to himself, to his
friends, or to his enemies&mdash;a very terrible man, whose
value, in those distracted times, was that he not only
made himself a terror to his enemies at home, but
also made England feared and respected abroad as she
had not been under the weak Stuart kings.
</p>

<p>
So now, by the middle of the seventeenth century,
we may at length truly say that Europe had passed
through that most miserable period of wars about
religion which accompanied and followed the Reformation.
We have to look on those religious wars as one
of the two great features in our story during that
half-century.  The other principal feature is the continual
expansion of the white Europeans into countries which
had been in the possession of men of colour.
</p>

<p>
England had sent a few ships, which effected little,
to help the Huguenots in their fight with the French
Crown, and we catch a far-off echo of that hostility
in the fighting which took place between English and
French over the French settlements in the St. Lawrence.
The French were defeated, but for the time being they
were allowed to remain in possession of their Canadian
settlements.

Quebec had been founded as early as 1608.  It was
not until 1641 that the foundations were laid of
Montreal.  But in the meantime Prince Edward's
Island, Nova Scotia, and several of the West Indian
islands had been occupied by English colonists.
</p>

<p>
Portugal during most of this half-century was
under the Spanish king.  She regained her complete
independence, under a king of her own, in 1640.  But
by that time she had lost her empire in the East.
Spain, sailing west from the New World, had arrived
at the Philippine Islands, which Portugal had reached
going east.  Thus neither had transgressed the famous
Bull.  And yet East and West did meet in those islands.
Drake, moreover, in his famous circumnavigation of
the world, had come to the neighbouring Spice Islands,
going west.
</p>

<p>
Both English and Dutch had taken a hand in
destroying the Portuguese claims to any exclusive
right of settlement in the East.  Between English
and Dutch, a decision was not reached so easily.
It was largely on account of the excessive prices
charged by the Dutch for pepper and other spices
brought from the East Indian islands that the British
East India Company was formed.  It received a
charter from the Crown to found settlements and claim
trading rights for England.  The Dutch so stubbornly
held and defended their trade in the islands that the
British gained no headway there until after the first
half of the century.  They did, however, make some
trading settlements on the mainland of India, of
which the earliest was in Madras, in 1639.
</p>

<p>
But an immediate impression was made on the
Dutch supremacy in the islands the moment that the
resolute policy of Cromwell took the place of the easy
indifference of the Stuarts.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE GROWING POWER OF FRANCE
</h3>

<p>
The event of chief importance in the story of the
second half of the seventeenth century is the gradual
shifting of the power in Europe from the hand of Spain
into the hand of France.  It was indeed in the earlier
half that Spain had begun to fail.  We have noticed
more than once how, with all the far-flung possessions
of her great ruling family of Habsburg&mdash;possessions in
Italy, in Austria, in the Netherlands&mdash;she held France
surrounded and hemmed in.  On the other hand,
France had all the advantage which, as is well known,
belongs to the "central position."  She could throw
her whole force into the struggle on this side or on that
far more easily than Spain could mass her force on any
one point.  And the very fact that Spain had so many
possessions to defend proved in the end her weakness.
She spent her vast strength in the struggle.  Moreover,
she had inflicted on herself a great loss by driving
out of the country the converted Jews and the
converted Mahommedans.  The last of the latter were
expelled in the tenth year of the seventeenth century,
and the Jews had gone long before.  Both were
intelligent and industrious people, and Spain thus lost
a most valuable section of her population.
</p>

<p>
She had immense wealth coming to her from
America, but the transport of this wealth made a
heavy demand on her fleet.  When Elizabeth was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
on the throne of England, English seamen, by their
constant attacks, drained much of the life-blood of
the Spanish fleet.  Under the vacillating rule of the
Stuarts, English attacks on the Spanish treasure ships
grew inconsiderable, but another formidable menace
to Spain had arisen in the sea-power of the Dutch.
</p>

<p>
The naval power of Holland had been necessary
to her during the war of religion in which Spain had
tried to crush out the Protestant spirit.  As early as
1607 the Dutch fleet had practically destroyed the
principal fleet of Spain off Gibraltar.  The Dutch, as
we have seen, had taken the supremacy which the
Portuguese had held in the Malay Archipelago; and
since Portugal till 1640 had been for sixty years under
the King of Spain, it was nearly equivalent to taking
that supremacy from Spain herself.  The victory
which really was decisive was won by the great Dutch
admiral, Van Tromp, in 1639.  It made Holland, so
lately a mere province of Spain, the strongest
sea-power in the world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cromwell as dictator
</span>
</p>

<p>
And at this point, that is to say, in 1651, Cromwell,
in his masterful manner, passed the law called the
Navigation Act which directly challenged the naval
power of Holland.  It provided that ships trading to
England should carry no other goods than those
produced in the country to which the ship belonged;
and this was a direct challenge to the Dutch because
they had a great carrying trade, and their ships brought
to England the goods produced in many other countries
besides their own.  Moreover, the English claimed that
the ships of all other nations meeting English ships in
the Channel, should salute them by lowering their flags.
The English admiral, Blake, meeting the Dutch fleet
under Van Tromp in the Channel, demanded that he
should lower the Dutch flag accordingly, and Van
Tromp's reply was a broadside from his guns.
</p>

<p>
As always, the English seamen fought with astonishing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
skill and courage.  Probably in the whole course
of this Greatest Story only one other nation, and that
the Dutch, has rivalled them in their genius for the
battle at sea.  After several actions the issue was still
open.  Van Tromp swept the Channel for a while,
after an English defeat, splicing a broom, by way of
derision, to his masthead.  But the English fleet was
strengthened; Blake came forth again from the Thames
and harried Van Tromp successfully.  While Cromwell
was Protector neither side had the decisive mastery.
The day of England's humiliation was to come later,
when a Dutch fleet sailed up the Thames and burned
English ships at Chatham; but that was not until
again a weak Stuart was on the throne.
</p>

<p>
What Cromwell and his Puritans did was amazing.
He had Ireland in rebellion on his hands.  He put
down that rising with an iron severity.  Rulers of
England before him had established those colonies
of Scottish and other immigrants which are the source
of the present division of Ireland into the Free State
in the south and the Northern Ireland which is still
directly under the English Government.  Cromwell's
plan to break up the centres of rebellion was to shift
sections of the Irish people themselves out of their
homes and plant them down in other parts of the
same country.  It was a policy that left a hatred of
English rule which still lives in the hearts of the
descendants of the people so mistreated.  But for the
moment it brought a forced peace.
</p>

<p>
Also on his hands was a Scottish rising, of the Church
party which was opposed equally to English Puritans
and to Scottish Covenanters.  That too he dealt with
masterfully and severely.  He was a virtual dictator.
</p>

<p>
The Parliament ventured to oppose him: he dissolved
the Parliament.  With indifference to the form
of all government recognised in England, he chose
eleven of his generals to act as his ministers.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
Army, with Cromwell as its head, was for the time
the governing body.  He was greatly hated, and still
more greatly feared.  Plots were formed against his
life; but none were successful.  He died peacefully
in 1658 and his portentous figure goes out of the story.
</p>

<p>
Like nearly every dictator, he left no under-study
able to play his part.  His son Richard, with little of
his father's hardness, was put, reluctantly, into his
place.  He retired at the first opportunity.  Within
little more than a year of the great Protector's death
the Army weakened, and the Parliament, which he
had overridden by that Army's aid, regained its power.
The Stuart who was king by hereditary right was
recalled.  The tremendous episode of the Commonwealth
was, to outward seeming, almost as if it had not
happened.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, that is, in 1659, France and Spain had
for the moment made terms of peace, of which one
article was that Louis XIV. should marry a Bavarian
princess, and another that France should take over
from Spain certain frontier fortresses and also a part
of the Spanish Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
That peace was maintained for some seven years,
during which Spain was much occupied by recurring
wars with Portugal, Portugal having thrown off the
Spanish sovereignty in 1640.
</p>

<p>
But a new king came to the throne of Spain, and
Louis put forward further claims in the Netherlands.
Louis, at the moment, was in alliance with Holland
against England in the war which had been provoked
by the Navigation Act.
</p>

<p>
A peace was now formally made by the English
Government with Holland, which was quickly followed
by an alliance between the two countries so lately at
war.  Yet, while this alliance was thus sealed by the
Government, Charles, King of England, on his own
account, and in return for sums of money advanced
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
to him by Louis, made a secret treaty of alliance with
the French.  Four years later, England and France,
as allies, declared war upon Holland.  A separate
peace was made between England and Holland two
years later again; but between France and Holland
the war continued for another four years.  A
temporary peace was then agreed to, but yet again Louis,
by further claims, provoked the war anew; and it
was while this war was in progress that William of
Holland became King of England, in succession to
James II., last of the Stuarts.
</p>

<p>
This conjunction naturally brought England and
Holland into a really active alliance, and so threw
England into war with France.  It was a war which
at first went badly for the allies, both on sea and land,
and England was menaced with invasion by the French&mdash;a
menace dispelled by the great English naval victory
of La Hogue in 1692.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Peace of Ryswick
</span>
</p>

<p>
On land also the Dutch gained some successes, and
in 1697 a general peace, to which Spain was one of
the signatories, was made at Ryswick.  By a former
treaty, some ten years earlier, Spain had given up, as
we have seen, part of her Netherlands possessions.
That treaty had been broken, as usual, by the
aggressive policy of the Grand Monarque, Louis XIV.  But
by the Peace of Ryswick, in 1697, Spain recovered a
portion of the Netherlands territory that had been
taken from her during the latter course of the war.
Nevertheless, only a year later&mdash;as we are able to
state now, though probably nothing was known of it
at the time&mdash;a secret pact was made between England,
France, and Holland for dividing up the Spanish
dominions.
</p>

<p>
The whole story is one of false dealing between
nations and of alliances so quickly shifting as to be
bewildering, and so guileful as to be offensive to all
faith in human nature.  But the very idea that there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
could be good faith between nations, or any other
guide for their conduct than the selfish interest of each,
never seems to have entered into the minds of the
statesmen of that day.  They may have been men of
honour in their personal dealings, but in their
international dealings such terms as honour and honesty
were empty words, conveying no meaning.
</p>

<p>
All through this portion of our story Christian
Europe was constantly in peril from the Turk on the
borders, and often far over the borders, of Austria and
Hungary.  Never was that menace greater than in
1683 when he was besieging Vienna with a great force.
He was defeated by Poles and Germans.  Yet at this
supreme crisis Louis, the Catholic King of France,
was secretly favouring the Moslems!
</p>

<p>
The story of our own country at this time is
especially humiliating.  Cromwell, in the early years
of the half-century which we have been considering,
had set England high in the estimation of the world.
But Cromwell had died, and with him had gone down
much for which he had so strongly stood.  Again two
Stuarts succeeded one another on England's throne,
and the English king, like a very Petit Monarque,
became a pensionary, a paid creature, of the Grand
Monarque of France.  Charles II. of England, and
James II. after him, with no sense of responsibility,
acted both as knaves and fools, though both had good
wits enough, had they used them rightly; and they
brought England into the very valley of humiliation.
Out of that humiliation she was rescued by the
accession to the English throne&mdash;jointly with his English
wife, daughter of James I.&mdash;of William of Orange,
ruler of Holland.  Englishmen of a later day have
perhaps been less grateful than they should be for
what some will call the happy accident, and others
the Providential dispensation, that, at this critical
moment, she found a king who had a sense of duty to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
his subjects, and a king who brought so valuable an
alliance as that of his Dutch fellow-countrymen.
</p>

<p>
Had some such foreign source of strength not come
to our country's aid, had the succession continued
in the Stuart line with other kings like those Stuarts
who had occupied the throne, it is not possible to say
what her fortunes might have been, but it is scarcely
possible to doubt that she must have fallen, for a while
at least, under the sovereignty of France.  As it was,
she had fallen under a most despotic rule by her own
kings.  Partly under the pretence that he was about
to make war against France, and partly by expending
money that he had secretly received from the French
king, Charles II. had raised a large army.  He had
employed it to stamp out all opposition at home.
The Grand Monarque was a strict Roman Catholic,
and he used all his power over his royal pensioners in
England to induce them to bring England back into the
fold of Rome.  But if anything were needed to make
the great majority of the English and Scottish people
yet more determined than before that the State
religion should not be that of Rome, a powerful
influence towards the stiffening of that determination was
supplied by a measure passed by Louis in 1685 and
known in history as the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Edict of Nantes revoked
</span>
</p>

<p>
That Edict of Nantes had permitted to the Huguenots,
the French Protestants, freedom to practise their
religion and to live under no disadvantages, as
compared with their fellow-countrymen of the Roman
Church.  The Revocation of the Edict not only
withdrew those permissions, but was accompanied and
followed by a deadly persecution under which many
of the Huguenots lost their lives and the survivors
fled to Protestant countries, especially to England and
to Holland.
</p>

<p>
It was a persecution and an expulsion very similar,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
in its motives and in its effects, to the flight from Spain
of the converted Jews and Mahommedans, and of the
Pilgrim Fathers and other Puritans from England.
It is curious that in each instance it was a flight of a
singularly industrious, intelligent, and valuable portion
of the population of each nation, and resulted in a
serious loss to those nations from which the exodus
was made.  And as they were a loss to those countries
which they left, so were they a gain to those which
received them.  The Huguenots in England retain to
this day those characteristics of valuable citizens.
Years before, England had been similarly fortunate
in receiving the Flemish weavers who had fled from
Flanders before the Inquisition and the Spanish armies
commanded by the Duke of Alva.
</p>

<p>
France could very ill afford such a loss.  Louis XIV.,
who came to the throne at the age of four years old in
1643 and lived until 1715, reigning thus no less than
seventy-two years, became towards the end of the
seventeenth century without dispute the greatest
monarch in Europe and in all the western world.  It
is safest to limit his greatness by that word "western,"
because in another part of the world-stage there was at
least one other monarch, the Emperor of China, who
could not conceive the possibility that there was a
human being so eminent as himself; and also in India
there was a very powerful sovereign of the Moguls
who yielded an authority and lived in a splendour
perhaps as great as either of these.
</p>

<p>
Louis's court at least was splendid beyond all
that had been seen in the West, his courtiers more
magnificent in their costumes and brilliancy, more
sumptuous in their expenditure.  Over the people
on their estates, the nobles had unbounded power.
Had the people been in very name slaves they could
not have been more enslaved in reality.  But even the
most powerful of the nobles was absolutely subservient
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
to the king.  He had an army, which was immense for
those days, at his command.
</p>

<p>
Consider, for a moment, what that power meant, in
the hands of one who had been a king since four years
old.  It meant that his will had always been law to
those about him.  He had heard only pleasant words,
because no one had dared tell him an unpleasant truth.
What chance, then, had he, coming to manhood in
such circumstances, of knowing anything of the real
truth about the world and about his subjects?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The French peasantry
</span>
</p>

<p>
The real truth about his subjects was, though Louis
did not know it, that their state was as utterly miserable
as that of human beings well could be.  They were
ground down not only by their local lords and nobles,
but also by the heavy taxes that they had to contribute
in order that the king should be able to keep up this
magnificence in his court, to pay so large an army and
to wage costly wars.  It was no part of the French
constitution, as of the English, that the money supplied
for the purposes of government should be voted by the
Parliament.  It is true that English kings often tried,
sometimes successfully, to extract such money without
a vote of Parliament; but at least the law was there,
for the people to appeal to, as a great fact in the English
constitution.  Its existence made a very great
difference.
</p>

<p>
Thus, while all went so gloriously with France upon
the surface and in the upper ranks, below, in those
foundations on which, after all, this splendid edifice
was based, there was misery and increasing poverty&mdash;poverty
which could have only one end, that there
would be no money to pay for the wars and for the
magnificence, and misery so intolerable that men would
rise and revolt against their conditions of life, no matter
how many should perish in the revolution.  We, now,
knowing what actually did come to pass, can see how
the forces were slowly accumulating which would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
bring it all about.  But from the eyes of men of that
time, living in the midst of it, the end was hidden;
and most of all, as we may suppose, hidden from that
resplendent monarch himself.
</p>

<p>
We may observe as curious that in the varying
struggle that we have seen going on between France,
Spain, England, and Holland during this half-century,
we hear so little of Germany taking a hand.  Certain
of the German States did, as a matter of fact, play
some small part, directly, in that struggle, either as
Protestants in alliance with the Protestant Dutch, or
later in their own defence against the claims of the
French king; but the reason why Germany, as a whole,
took no continuous or large share, by direct action at
the centre, was in the first place that her power was
much broken up&mdash;she was split into a number of
separate States, with no strong central authority to
combine their action; secondly, that indirectly she
really was playing a part that was important&mdash;serving
as a guard to keep back the Turk on the south-eastern
corner of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Always we have to remember, in considering the
action of our story at this period, that there was this
menace from the Turk pressing in on the side of Austria
and Hungary.  The power of Russia was rising, but
she was continuously engaged in wars farther north&mdash;with
Sweden and with Poland.  The fortunes of these
wars went variously, and to no decisive result.  At
one time we do indeed see Poland and Russia in alliance
against the Turk; but no decision was reached in that
war either.  Peter the Great, well named for the
greatness to which he brought his country, came to
the Russian throne in 1682.  But great Russia was as
yet only in process of establishing herself and was beset
by enemies.  She was soon to be a very prominent
actor in the world's story, but her time had not then
come.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
</p>

<p>
Turkey was fighting on all her land borders, and
carrying on an indecisive naval war with the Venetians
the while.  The Venetians gained part of Greece from
the Turks; the Austrians took Belgrade from them;
several of the Balkan States maintained their
independence.  Evidently the fighting force of the Turks
was not as powerful as it had been.  By the end of
the century they were more concerned with keeping
the large empire that they had won than in adding to
it by further conquests; and they made peace, for the
time being, with Russia, Poland, Austria, and Venice.
</p>

<p>
As yet there was no Italian nation to play a part
in the contest which had now ended in the transference
to France of the overmastering power in the world
which had been Spain's.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Spanish Succession
</span>
</p>

<p>
We have noticed how a secret pact had been made
between England, France, and Holland for partitioning
the domains of Spain.  But the King of Spain, dying
in 1700, gave, by will, the whole of his possessions
to Philip of Aragon, grandson of Louis XIV.  The
inheritor was an infant.  The Grand Monarque did
not hesitate, in spite of the secret pact, to accept
the inheritance on his grandson's behalf.  It was an
arrangement which would have given his family more
power than even the house of Habsburg had possessed.
It menaced the liberty of England, of Holland, and of
all Europe.  The War of the Spanish Succession, which
occupied the first years of the eighteenth century, was
waged to oppose it.  England's portion in that war
in the Netherlands is commonly known to Englishmen
as the Wars of Marlborough, from the great leader, the
Duke of Marlborough, who commanded in them.
</p>

<p>
England and Holland, then, had been drawn into
natural alliance, after years of fighting, by the
establishment on the throne of England of William of Orange
who married Mary, the heiress to the Crown; but
James II., the rightful king, still lived.  He was king
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
by right of inheritance, but had used his kingship so
wrongfully, in such direct opposition to the wishes of
his people, that he had been driven from the throne
and from the country.  He fled to France where he
could be sure of a friendly welcome from a Catholic
king.  The favour that he had shown, contrary to the
law of England, to English Catholics had been a great
part of his wrongdoing in the eyes of his people.
Moreover, Louis was well disposed to aid any enemy of the
ruler of Holland.
</p>

<p>
So there came assistance of French troops for James,
a landing in Catholic Ireland, and a march, leading to
the famous Battle of the Boyne, wherein, in 1690,
James and his Catholics suffered a defeat, at the hands
of William and his Protestants, which meant the end
in England of the Stuarts, the Jacobite kings.  That
battle further meant the firm establishment as King of
England, Scotland, and Ireland of this ruler of Holland
who was married to Mary, the daughter of the last
Jacobite king.  It was his own father-in-law that
William succeeded on the throne, and the father-in-law
still lived.
</p>

<p>
He lived, and not only was made welcome at the
Court of France, but also had many faithful to his cause
in England.  But William ruled wisely, and his hold
on power grew steadily.  The Dutch guards that he
had brought with him from Holland gave offence to
his English subjects.  He had the sound sense to
remove the offence and send the guards back to Holland.
The very idea that the king should have what we call
"a standing army" was still new and strange to
Englishmen.  They had been accustomed to armies
raised for special wars, but not until rather lately to
soldiers maintained under arms in time of peace.  The
idea of a foreign regiment in their midst was naturally
not agreeable.
</p>

<p>
It was in the last year of the century that William
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
sent back his Dutch guards, and surely gained, rather
than lost, in security on the throne by doing so.  He
died three years later.  His wife had died before him,
and he was succeeded by yet another daughter of
James II., "the good Queen Anne," wisest of the
Stuart monarchs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Settlement of America
</span>
</p>

<p>
All through the troubles of that last half-century
Englishmen in increasing numbers sought refuge from
them in America where land, fertile land, appeared to
be unlimited for all who chose to take it and could
keep it against the attacks of the Red Indians whom
they drove out.  Spain was predominant in Mexico
and in South America, and in North America she
claimed and insecurely held a land of indefinite
boundaries which she called Florida.  But it was a
land of woods and prairies of unknown extent whither
the Spanish conquerors did not go.  The very name
Florida has a Spanish sound; and in the same way
Louisiana, with its capital city of New Orleans, tells
the story of French settlement.  It was farther north,
however, along the shores of that great St. Lawrence
estuary running up into Canada, that English and
French fell, as we have seen already, to fighting for the
new lands.  From Virginia southwards, the settlement
that Sir Walter Raleigh had so named in honour of his
queen, nearly up to the St. Lawrence, were vast lands
along the eastern sea-board which the English explored
without meeting enemies other than the Indians.
</p>

<p>
From time to time there were hideous massacres
of the white men; but the Indians were too poorly
armed and generally too disunited to make serious
opposition to the settlers.  There was a settlement
of the Dutch, at an early date, a little southward of
the present New York; and farther south again a
settlement of the Swedes; but both became
incorporated in the larger numbers of the English.
</p>

<p>
Just as the name Florida speaks of Spain, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
Louisiana of the Grand Monarque of France, so we find
other States on the eastern sea-board with names that
have a story to tell us of our own monarchs.  For
there are, besides Elizabeth's Virginia.  Mary's Maryland,
and the Carolinas of the Charleses; later, Georgia,
of the Georges.  The titles, however, do not indicate
the dates of the settlement of the various States which
bear them.
</p>

<p>
It is well to have the atlas open at the map of
North America when we discuss these colonies.  We
shall see thereon a name Pennsylvania, which tells us
of the pilgrims led out by the Quaker, Penn.  Maryland,
we should note, which is called after the Catholic queen,
was resorted to largely by the Catholics.  New England
was the centre of Puritan migration.  There was a
religious reason, in the first instance, for many of the
settlements in America.  We have seen before how
glad men were to be quit of those of an alien religion
from their midst; and also how glad those aliens
were to go.  Montreal, on its first settlement, in 1542,
was a Catholic establishment.  The Jesuits were
pressing out to the farthest West in this quarter of the
globe, converting the Red Indians, as they also pressed
eastward about the same time to India, China, and to
Japan.  But Montreal had to become a military and
an industrial settlement too.  All the early settlers,
whatever interpretation they put on the Bible, had to
carry the sword, as well as the Cross, with them.  They
had, in truth, scant semblance of right in their complaint
that the Indians were always ready to turn and
massacre them.  Were they not expelling the Indians,
who had done them no manner of harm, out of their
own homes?
</p>

<p>
The French, in these early days, explored and
claimed possession of an immense territory in North
America.  We may trace it all along both sides of the
gulf and the river of St. Lawrence, and westward to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
the Great Lakes.  Southward we may trace it along
wide lands watered by the Ohio, and down the
Mississippi until we come out at New Orleans.  Mobile,
at the river's mouth, was even earlier settled by the
French.
</p>

<p>
All this, from the Great Lakes southward, lay
westward and inland of the English settlement along the
coast.  But the limits of the territories claimed were
not very clearly drawn; at first it was only by a fort
here and there, and not by any continuous settlement,
that possession of the vast lands was claimed and
partially made good by the white men.  The upper
Mississippi was explored before the end of the century,
and some settlement had been made of the Canadian
north-west.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Settlements in the East
</span>
</p>

<p>
Progress, as ever, was more slow in the East.  It
was in 1652 that the Dutch colonised the Cape of Good
Hope.  Amongst those Dutch colonists, and of the same
reformed religion, were a number of the Huguenots
from France.  In 1661 the English colonised the Gold
Coast, on the west of Africa, where the Portuguese
had previously been in possession, and in the same year
Portugal ceded to the English Crown what soon proved
to be of the greatest importance to England in the
East, the province of Bombay in India.
</p>

<p>
So saying, we have to understand that the hold of
any of the western nations on India was almost confined
to the coasts and to the ports.  It did not go far into
the country.
</p>

<p>
Bombay, in this sense of its coastal trading towns,
was transferred by the Crown to the East India
Company a year or two later, and some twenty-five
years later again a disaster happened which made its
possession of the first value to England, for in the
attempt to increase their holding in Bengal the English
were so heavily defeated that they were driven out
of that province altogether.  Bengal and Madras had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
been separated for purposes of the administration of
their Governments some years before.  But now the
headquarters of the Company were established in
Bombay, after the temporary loss of Bengal.  It was
in the first year of the new century that Calcutta was
founded.
</p>

<p>
Thus went the story along the Indian coasts; but
in India itself the Mahommedan power of the Moguls,
which we have spoken of before, was now rising to its
zenith.  This was in the reign of the great Aurungzeb.
And at the same time, in spite of this supremacy of
the Moguls, arose into prominence two principal races
of the Hindus, the Mahrattas and the Sikhs.  The
power of all three was to be greatly diminished in the
years to come, but their rise is of particular interest
because it is the division between Mahommedans and
Hindus which is the main cause of unrest in India
to-day, and also the reason why the native Indians are
incapable of uniting so as to throw off a foreign yoke
altogether.  If that yoke were removed the fighting
between these opposed elements would certainly be
fatal to the well-being of the country.  It is just about
the date at which we have now arrived in this Greatest
Story that we see the two elements most clearly in
opposition.
</p>

<p>
Another event of much importance for England's
future empire in India happened about the same date
on India's north-west border: that state of Afghanistan,
at length, after prolonged and doubtful fighting against
Persia, finally gained its independence.  Its importance
is that it thus became what we call a "buffer state,"
preventing the direct collision of Russia with the
Indian Empire.  That threatened collision, and the
value of the "buffer state," was not in evidence in
the story at this time; but it was at this time that the
foundation of its future value to England was laid.

<p>
The Court of the Great Mogul in India is one of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
those two which were mentioned a few pages back as
rivalling in its splendour that of the Grand Monarque
himself.  The other is that of China, where a new
dynasty, the Manchus, came by conquest to the throne.
As usual, it was by way of invasion of a people from
the north, more warlike and less civilised than the
Chinese.  As usual, the warlike conquerors lost their
own characteristics among the multitudes of the more
civilised nation.  But they kept the throne till close on
the end of the eighteenth century, and by enforcing
some sort of authority, from Pekin as a centre, they
brought the empire to greater prosperity than it had
known during the very many previous years in which
it had been distracted by feuds between the local
chieftains.  Tibet, the land of the "Forbidden City"
of Lhasa, with its wonderful Potala, the palace of the
holy Lama, was conquered and absorbed for a while
into the huge empire.
</p>

<p>
But the fortunes of China and the glories of the
Emperor's court had very little influence in the making
of the great world story.  It was a land, a vast land,
apart.  And it did not move.  How stationary it was
is indicated by the curious fact that although China
is credited with the invention and use of gunpowder
before any of the western nations, the only artillery
that they had for their defence against the Manchu
invaders was cast for them by the Jesuits, Jesuit
missionaries from the West.  With a beautiful impartiality,
the Jesuits are said to have cast cannon for the
Manchus also.  It is truly a remarkable circumstance
that these emissaries, devoted, at the imminent risk
of their lives, to carrying the Christian faith all over
the world, should be thus engaged in making munitions
of war.  But the members of this singular religious
order were always practical, always active as politicians
in all the countries into which they went.  And there
were none which they did not penetrate.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Populations of East and West
</span>
</p>

<p>
At first the Jesuits were made welcome in China,
but a reaction against all western people seems to have
taken place when the Manchu emperor was firmly
established on his throne.  Japan also set her face
against the new trade that was carried out in Dutch
and Portuguese vessels.  Moreover, in 1662 the Dutch
suffered a heavy reverse in being driven out of the
island of Formosa, after long and hard fighting.  The
beginning of the eighteenth century really saw the doors
of the far East more firmly closed to the West than they
had been fifty years before.  The far East therefore
was, for the time being, even less in the world story
than it had been.  But it had its own story, which
sufficed for itself, and it was a story in which very
many actors played a part.  The western lands were
still what we should reckon very thinly populated.
Our England, for instance, nearly certainly did not have
a population of more than five millions and a half
at the end of the seventeenth century.  But already
there must have been a relatively dense population in
China.  In Pekin, in an appalling earthquake that
happened in 1661, it is said that 400,000 people lost
their lives.  Now the total population of London in
1685 is put at only a little more than half a million, and
London was already far and away the largest town in
our country, seventeen times larger than Bristol, which
then was second to it in numbers.  North of the Trent,
the country was still scarcely civilised or settled at
all.  But after nightfall the unlighted streets of the
cities were probably more dangerous than any part of
the country.  Near London even, at a much later date,
it was the law that all the covert near the high roads
should be cut away so as to leave less shelter for the
lurking highwaymen; but still the picturesque Dick
Turpins abounded.  And high roads, roads along which
a coach might go, ever so slowly, sometimes drawn by
oxen, were few, and these few were bad.  Great men
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
travelled with six horses to their coach and a large
following, not for honour and glory but because it was
likely that the pulling power of six horses and even
more might be required to draw the coach through
the marshy places of the road&mdash;and in the undrained
and unenclosed country the marshy places were many.
Nor were the numerous retainers for vain show: they
were for necessary protection, and at any moment
might have to use their arms.
</p>

<p>
When the fields began to be enclosed and drained,
they would grow more corn or pasture and so help to
support a larger population; but the enclosing meant
that much of the waste, where the poor people had
picked firewood and perhaps caught or killed some
game, were taken from them.  And as it was in
England, so too was it in other European countries as
they advanced in civilisation.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the main, then, the story of the latter half of the
seventeenth century is the story of the shifting of the
great power in the world from Spain to France.  The
story of the early years of the eighteenth century is
in the main the story of the opposition of the other
nations to the carrying out of the provisions of the will
of the King of Spain by which he bequeathed all that
was Spain's to the grandson of the French king.  Had
those provisions been faithfully executed they would
have thrown so great power and wealth into the hands
of the ruler of France that no other nation could have
lived at ease under so vast a menace.  Already
France had submitted to some check in agreeing to the
provisions of the Peace of Ryswick.  But she was
arrogant and aggressive still.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE HUMBLING OF FRANCE
</h3>

<p>
We may probably say that no other man has made so
great a difference to the history of the world, by his
last will and testament, as did the King of Spain by
that will which left all his monarchy to the grandson
of him who already was so great as to be called the
Grand Monarque.  He willed away his vast territories,
as it had been a five-acre field, and his subjects, of
many nationalities, as they had been the sheep or
cattle thereon.
</p>

<p>
And the Grand Monarque, by accepting the gift
on behalf of his infant grandson, united his enemies
so that they forgot their own mutual quarrels and
formed a great alliance against him.
</p>

<p>
But he was very strong.  He had a huge army, he
had great wealth, and he had the advantage of being
at the centre of the theatre of conflict, while his foes
were on the circumference.
</p>

<p>
The most formidable in the alliance against him
were the English and the Dutch.  William III.,
husband of Mary, daughter of James II., was on the
English throne.  As Protestants and Stuarts, Mary
and her sister Anne, who succeeded in 1702, in some
degree conciliated both parties in England.  William
III., besides being married to England's queen, was
himself of the English Royal line, being a grandson
of Charles I.  An Act of Settlement, as it was called,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
had been passed by the English Parliament which
should exclude, after Anne's death, a son born to
James II. by a second marriage.  This son, a Catholic,
thus excluded, received welcome at the French Court
and became the centre of Jacobite intrigues for the
Crown of England.  It was his recognition as King of
England by Louis XIV. which determined William III. to
support with all his forces what came to be known
as the Grand Alliance against France.  William,
however, died suddenly as the result of an accident
before the war really began.
</p>

<p>
Queen Anne then, came to the throne, and the command
of the allied English and Dutch forces was taken
by John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough.  He
proved himself a great general.  His first great victory
was in the battle of Blenheim in 1704, followed by that
of Ramillies two years later.  The French had received
so heavy a beating that the Grand Monarque sought
peace; but the terms offered did not satisfy the
victors.
</p>

<p>
The war was not restricted to the Netherlands.  The
little country of Portugal was in the alliance; so too
was, for a while, another small country, the Duchy of
Savoy in the north-west corner of Italy.  Later Savoy
went over to the Habsburg party.  The Emperor was
on the side of the allies.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Netherlands, the allies were victorious
in Bavaria, in Italy, and for a moment in Spain itself.
The approach of an English army to Madrid actually
forced the king to leave his throne and his capital;
but that advance was not maintained, the allies were
defeated in Spain, and he was re-established.  Between
English and French, the war was fought so far from
home as Canada&mdash;much to the English advantage in the
peace by which it was concluded.  But before Louis
would make peace on terms that the allies were willing
to accept, his armies had to suffer further defeat in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
Netherlands at the hands of Marlborough.  Oudenarde
in 1708 and Malplaquet in the following year are the
places and dates of these two English victories which
were really decisive of the war.
</p>

<p>
Marlborough's success and the ascendancy which
he and his duchess had gained over the queen, made
him many enemies at home.  We begin about this
time to hear of the two great political parties, Tories
and Whigs.  Marlborough was of the latter party,
which was in power till 1710, in which year they lost
place to the former.  Marlborough was dismissed from
his command in the year following; and with his
dismissal negotiations for peace were renewed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Peace of Utrecht
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was not until 1713 that its terms were finally
agreed, in the Peace of Utrecht; and in the main it
gave the allies what they had fought for.  Certain
frontier fortress towns were ceded to the Netherlands
by France.  Louis, as representing the Habsburg
house, gave up all claim to the Spanish Netherlands.
The King of Spain was recognised as ruler in his own
country, but renounced all right to the French Crown.
On the other hand, it was the Peace of Utrecht that
made Austria dominant for many years in Italy.
In Canada, England gained a large territory from the
French.
</p>

<p>
Look where we may on the scene of the great
story in this period, we find great misery everywhere.
No sooner had the wars of religion ceased than there
began those wars over the succession to the thrones
of the newly formed or forming nations.  It seems
that as soon as the people began to have any sense of
nationality, as we say&mdash;any feeling that as a nation
they had an existence free and independent of the
others&mdash;they at once found themselves faced by the
danger of some one nation, or some one Royal house
ruling several nations, becoming so strong as to take
their liberty from them.  First were the Habsburgs
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
and next the power of Spain, then that of France:
nor have we even so by any means come to the end of
these wars of succession.  We have to hear of more.
The nations could no longer endure the idea of an
empire such as Charlemagne's, with authority over
them.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor, still so-called, had little power: it
was scarcely more than nominal over the German
States by which he was elected.  About the date of the
Peace of Utrecht, an event took place in those German
States which was to be of much importance in the
future.  That was the accession of the Elector&mdash;the
ruler who had a vote for the election of the Emperor&mdash;of
Brandenburg, to the throne of Prussia.  Its
import, of course, was not seen at the time, but it was
the beginning of the dominance of Prussia over
Germany.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor, with such power as he might command,
had been one of the allies against Louis, but
he had his own troubles on his north-eastern boundary
to occupy his attention.  We have before now, in
course of the story, seen a King of Sweden coming
down from the north and fighting in Germany.  That
was in the days of the great Gustavus Adolphus,
commanding the Protestant forces and dying in the
hour of victory at Lutzen, near Leipsic.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Charles XII
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, in the early years of the eighteenth century,
we have another King of Sweden, Charles XII., fighting
in Germany; but it is no religious war that he is waging.
He is fighting in the first place to maintain his right
to his kingdom of Sweden.  Kings of Sweden had
at one time or other coveted the throne of Poland.
But also more than one King of Poland had laid claim
to the throne of Sweden.  And now, although this
claim had been formally renounced, Charles XII. had
no sooner acceded, than Danes (including
Norwegians), Poles, and Russians united to dethrone
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
him.  That very remarkable ruler, Peter the Great,
was at this time Tsar.
</p>

<p>
The young King of Sweden first met and defeated
the Danes, next the Russians, and then marched his
victorious troops into Poland, which he conquered
and overran.  As a result of his victories he seems to
have gained little, however, beyond the maintenance
of his own throne in Sweden, and, after remaining
two years or more in Poland, he set a king of his own
nomination, Leszynska, on its throne, made peace with
his enemies and went back to his own country.  Three
years later, however, he was again fighting in Russia,
and it was during this campaign, that his armies pushed
into Germany also.  In Russia he finally suffered an
overwhelming defeat at Pultowa: this was in 1709,
and one result of that disaster was that his nominee lost
the crown of Poland.
</p>

<p>
After Pultowa, Charles fled to the Turks, engaged
them as his allies and persuaded them to send an army
of invasion into Russia; but after a short campaign
peace was made between Russia and Turkey, and in
1714 Charles returned to his own country.  He died
four years later; and thereafter Sweden was no more
a great actor in our story.  The power of Russia, on
the other hand, continually increased, and within
a few years Russian armies were victoriously
overrunning Sweden itself.  The Swedes, nevertheless,
preserved their independence, but were no longer
dangerously aggressive to the nations south of the
Baltic.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
FROM THE PEACE OF UTRECHT TO THE PEACE OF AIX-LA-CHAPELLE
</h3>

<p>
In the last, short, chapter I tried to tell the story of
the early years of the eighteenth century up to the
Peace of Utrecht in 1713.  Principally it is the story
of the humbling of France, and of the checking of the
ambition of Louis XIV. to unite in his descendants,
together with the Crown of France, all that was
included in the monarchy of Spain.  That ambitious
design was checked, and from now onward we shall
see that a great motive in the story is the preservation
of what became known as "the balance of power in
Europe"; so that no one nation should have too
preponderant a superiority over the rest.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the present chapter is to carry
forward the story to the middle of the century, or,
more precisely, to another very important peace
treaty, that between England and France, signed at
Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748.
</p>

<p>
The Peace of Utrecht had indeed included in its
provisions a settlement between England and France;
but within a few years war broke out again in Europe,
which involved both these countries, and again it was
war over the succession to thrones.  There was war
over the succession to the throne of Poland, to the
throne of Austria, and, although it is not written of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
by historians as a war of succession, it really was a
small war of the same kind in which England very
soon found herself engaged in Scotland..  And, as
ever of old, France and her Catholic king sided with the
Scottish Catholics against the English Protestant king.
The Court of France had, as we have noted, given
welcome and shelter to the son, by his second marriage,
of James II., who had a claim by birth to the English
Crown.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Hanoverian English Kings
</span>
</p>

<p>
But by a recent law of England no Catholic could
succeed to the throne.  The Act of Settlement gave
the Crown of England to George, Elector of Hanover,
who was a Protestant and son of a Protestant
grand-daughter of James I.  It was thus that the Hanoverian
dynasty, represented by our present King George V.,
attained the throne of England.  Until Queen
Victoria's accession, the sovereignty of Hanover,
which became a kingdom when the Bourbon king was
restored to the throne of France, also belonged to the
King of England.  But the laws of Hanover did not
recognise succession through the female line, or admit
of a queen as ruler; and therefore the two Crowns
were separated when Victoria became sovereign of
England.
</p>

<p>
The son of James II. came over to Scotland in
1715 and raised a revolt there, with the aid of some of
the Highland clans; but this rising, known in history,
from its date, as "The Fifteen," was easily put down
and made no abiding mark on the story.
</p>

<p>
The next, which really was of some importance, of
the wars of succession was that waged about the throne
of Poland.  It was a throne, as we have seen, in frequent
dispute, but generally the trouble was fought out
between Russia, Sweden, and Poland itself, with
eastern German States taking some hand in it.  Usually
these German States acted as a kind of buffer between
that particular trouble and the West of Europe,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
rather as Austria, southward, acted as a buffer for the
West against the Turk.  But now the King of France
was drawn into the fight, because he had married a
daughter of the Leszynska whom Charles of Sweden
had made King of Poland for a few years before the
disastrous overthrow of the Swedes at Pultowa.
Russia supported the cause of a rival candidate to the
throne, and Leszynska and his French allies were
defeated.  The chief importance of this war of the
Polish succession, for the general story, is that it
resulted in a large increase of Russia's power over
Poland.  The successive rulers of Russia began to be
more and more fully recognised as the heads of the
Slav people and the supreme upholders of the Greek
Church.
</p>

<p>
At the same time another power, a Protestant
power, that of Prussia, was becoming more and more
formidable along the shores of the Baltic to the north
of Poland, and the time is near at hand when we shall
see these two, Russia and Prussia, playing a very
leading part in the story.
</p>

<p>
For the moment, however, the western nations are
perhaps not considering them greatly.  They are
occupied with wars amongst themselves.  France and
Spain are in arms against each other within a very few
years after the peace signed at Utrecht.  In the
Mediterranean, fighting is nearly perpetual.  Venice
takes part of Greece from the Turks, and the Turks
regain it.  Italy and the islands of Corsica, Sardinia,
and Sicily are the scenes of battles and exchanges
of territory.  But still we have to remember what we
have seen reason to note before, that we should quite
misunderstand the effect of the wars if we were to
estimate them by anything like the scale which the last
Great War has painfully made known to us.  The
fighting was all done by the professional soldiers, and
the numbers engaged were what we should deem
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
very small, even in comparison with the far smaller
population of the countries at that date.  The area of
the fighting was restricted, so that comparatively small
tracts were laid waste; nor was the land so cultivated
as it is now.  There were not the same crops to be
destroyed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Austrian Succession
</span>
</p>

<p>
After the war over the Spanish Succession, which
terminated with the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, the most
important of the wars of the same kind was that over
the succession to the Austrian throne, which begun
in 1740 on the accession of Maria Theresa, who was
the daughter and heiress of the Emperor and Austrian
Grand Duke, Charles VI.
</p>

<p>
Frederick II., King of Prussia, known in history
as Frederick the Great, appears to have thought the
opportunity good for getting a slice of Austrian territory
for himself.  It was that land which was called Silesia,
and he claimed it on the ground that it had at one
time belonged to the Electors of Brandenburg.  The
Electors of Brandenburg, we shall remember, had
become rulers of the kingdom of Prussia.
</p>

<p>
Frederick was a great general, and two successive
victories quickly induced Maria Theresa to make peace
with him, ceding him a portion of that Silesia for which
he had gone to war.
</p>

<p>
Maria Theresa was married to Francis of Lorraine,
who was Grand Duke of Tuscany.  She was of the
Habsburg house.  Louis XIV. was a Bourbon&mdash;a
younger branch of the Capet family&mdash;and in direct
descent from the Henry IV., who was the first of the
Bourbons to be King of France.  And of the same
Bourbon family was the King of Spain and of Southern
Italy and Sicily&mdash;"the Two Sicilies," as they were
called.
</p>

<p>
Nearly thirty years before his death, the Emperor
Charles had secured the assent of the great powers of
Europe to his decree that if he died without sons his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
daughter should succeed to the Austrian dominions.
The Bourbons, with others, had assented.  Nevertheless,
directly Charles died and Maria Theresa,
according to this arrangement, claimed to succeed
him, they took sides with the Elector of Bavaria, who
claimed the throne.
</p>

<p>
For allies, she had only England, with Hanover,
in the north, and, in the south, the small but ancient
kingdom of Savoy, often, in course of the story, the
object of fighting between France and Spain, yet still,
after varying fortunes, maintaining its independence.
Moreover, Sardinia, which had long been a Spanish
possession, now belonged to Savoy.  The armies of
this small State had a great reputation, due to the
genius for generalship shown by Prince Eugene of
Savoy both against the Turks and in Marlborough's
service.
</p>

<p>
Mainly, however, it was the valour and devotion of
the Hungarians that saved Austria for Maria Theresa.
The armies of France and Bavaria advanced through
Russian territory, but they were flung back by
Hungarians and Austrians.  Maria Theresa returned
to the throne from which she had fled.  Her principal
enemy, the Bavarian Elector, who had been chosen as
Emperor, died, and her own husband, Francis, was
elected Emperor in his place.
</p>

<p>
In the north, England and France met in the battles
of Dettingen and Fontenoy.  The English were
assisted by the Dutch, for Holland was now a member
of the alliance, but neither of the allies gained much
glory in the campaign.  They did at least divert some
of the strength of France from the Austrian battlefields,
while the armies of Savoy occupied the attention
of Spain in Italy and also of such troops as France had
to spare for that quarter of the far-flung war.  Frederick
the Great broke his word, with the cynicism which the
Prussian has always shown since, and took the field
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
on the side of France and Bavaria.  Again he was
victorious.  He was confirmed in possession of Silesia,
though he assented to the election of Francis as
Emperor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle
</span>
</p>

<p>
The result of this various fighting was summed up
in the Provisions of the famous Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
signed at that place in 1748.  Maria Theresa
was established on the Austrian throne, with the formal
assent of the other powers.  Her dominion in Northern
Italy, including Milan and Tuscany, was confirmed.
And the territory of Savoy was extended.  In the
south, the Bourbon king of the Two Sicilies retained
these dominions.  Thus, in the main, the position of
neither Spain nor of France was greatly affected.  We
may note that one of the treaty provisions put Genoa
under the protection of France.  That may seem a
detail rather small for attention in so outlined a story
as this.  It is, however, a detail of which the importance
must be realised when we observe that Genoa claimed
a sovereignty over the little island of Corsica.  Corsica
shortly afterwards rebelled against this sovereignty,
with the ultimate result that the island was annexed
by France in 1755.  And in 1769 was born, in Corsica,
Napoleon Bonaparte.
</p>

<p>
It was in direct consequence, therefore, of this
protectorate of Genoa by France under the Peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle, and of France's annexation of Corsica
a few years later, that Napoleon was born a French
subject.  That seemingly accidental circumstance was
of some importance in the world's history.
</p>

<p>
The disposition of the various States in Italy, made
by this Peace of 1748, was maintained with little
disturbance until the armies of the French Republic,
under the leadership of the wonderful Corsican, broke
up every European disposition.
</p>

<p>
If France, in the course of this war over the Austrian
succession, had possessed an army free for an attack
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
in any force on England, it might have gone very
hardly for our country.  The son of James II., known
as the Old Pretender (pretender to the Crown of
England) was still living at the French Court in 1745;
and in that year his son, Charles Edward, the Young
Pretender, landed in Scotland, and led that rising which
is known from its date as "the Forty-five."  With the
Highland clans to aid, he gained victories over the
English generals sent against him, he conquered
practically all Scotland and made his way southward
in England as far as Derby.
</p>

<p>
If he had shown determination, if he had pushed on
towards London, it is quite likely that much of the
future story of England and of the whole Anglo-Saxon
community in the world might have to be written
very differently.  For England was not warmly
devoted to her Hanoverian kings.  The Young
Pretender might have picked up many more adherents as
he went south.  Had a French force been poured in to
his assistance at this critical moment, it seems to be
the opinion of historians that his cause would have
been won.
</p>

<p>
But no French force appeared.  Probably France
had all her available armies fully engaged.  Charles
Edward did not show determination.  He went back
to Edinburgh, and the clans, held together by no
central authority, but only by their sympathy with
the Scottish royal family of Stuart, dispersed to their
Highland homes.  For a while the Pretender played
the king in Edinburgh, but at length a strong English
force under the Duke of Cumberland was sent to
Scotland.  A decisive engagement was fought on the
wild moor of Culloden, near Inverness.  It settled for
all time the fate of the Stuart dynasty, and set
the Hanoverians firmly on the throne of England.
The clans which had arisen for the Stuarts in the
previous attempt by the Old Pretender in "the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
Fifteen" had suffered slight punishment at the hands
of the victorious English.  After "the Forty-five," on
the contrary, their punishment was cruelly severe;
but it had at least the effect of quelling their spirit
so that they did not imperil the peace of the realm
again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ireland's misfortunes
</span>
</p>

<p>
At the same moment, towards the middle of this
eighteenth century, Ireland was in terrible suffering
also.  In 1739 had happened her worst famine, due
to failure of the potatoes on which most of the people
depended, almost entirely, for their livelihood.  It
was estimated that no less than one-fifth of the
population actually died, and there can be no doubt that
the effect of that starvation on the survivors must
have been to weaken the stock for more than one
generation.
</p>

<p>
And we are obliged to confess, with shame, that
England's dealing with Ireland during all that
half-century was as cruel and selfish as it was stupid and
short-sighted.  There was a moment when it seems as
if the people of the smaller island were anxious for
union with the greater; but that union was opposed
by a section of the English themselves&mdash;especially
the powerful section interested in the trade of wool
with the continent of Europe.  A law passed as far
back as the second half of the seventeenth century
prohibited the Irish from exporting cattle.  Consequently
they had largely devoted their excellent pasture
to producing sheep, for the wool.  The English wool
traders wished to keep this profitable commerce to
themselves.  To attain that selfish end they opposed
the proposed union, which presumably would have put
the Irish wool producers on the same footing as the
English.  Further, under William III., they succeeded
in passing through Parliament a bill prohibiting the
Irish from either making up their home-grown wool or
from exporting it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
</p>

<p>
The not unnatural result was that the unfortunate
Irish turned to all sorts of secret devices for shipping
their wool, contrary to the provisions of this
extraordinarily cruel law, to France; and this secret
traffic is generally regarded as the starting-point of all
the many secret societies, the Whiteboys, the Fenians,
and so on, which have figured largely in Ireland's
later political story.  So much of the bitter feud
between England and Ireland has been due to the
folly and injustice of the former nation!  For all our
just pride in the greatness of our country, we must try
to keep a clear vision and not let that proper pride
blind us to England's faults.
</p>

<p>
One of the reasons why I suggested that a French
force landing in England in "the Forty-five" might
have changed the subsequent story of the Anglo-Saxon
people, is that it might have had the result of modifying
those very stupid measures by which England drove
her American colonies to revolt, and so caused the
separation from the mother land of the United States.
It is always interesting to speculate about what might
have happened to the world story had this or the other
event gone just a little differently.  It is interesting;
but we can never know the answers to such questioning.
The story of that lamentable separation belongs to the
second half of the century with which we are now
dealing.  For the moment preparation is in making
for it by the continual increase of the English colonists
and their continual expansion over more and more
of the virgin land.  But still the French are in possession
of all that vast extent then included under the name
of Louisiana.
</p>

<p>
In a former chapter we saw how unmeasured were
the hopes of Spain regarding that fabled city of El
Dorado, which seems to have been imagined as built
and paved with gold.  In the new world which the
voyagers of the previous century had begun to open
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
out for men of Europe, no vision seemed impossible
to realise, and the French, in their American possessions,
appear to have deemed that they had found something
equivalent to a city of gold&mdash;a land with boundless
possibilities of wealth.  Nor were the less imaginative
English immune from the like delusive dreams.  We
had our "South Sea Bubble"; the French their
"Mississippi Bubble."
</p>

<p>
Bubble was the name applied to those schemes only
when they had proved themselves, by bursting, to be
filled with nothing more substantial or golden than the
air.  The English bubble, at its inception, was a grave
business proposition styled the South Sea Company.
The French equivalent was the Mississippi Company,
or Compagnie de l'Occident.  Like the East India
Company, these were formed by persons who subscribed
funds for exploiting the wealth, real or imaginary, of
the countries indicated by the titles of each.  Shares
in both one and the other rose to ridiculous values; and
the bursting of the one, as of the other, brought ruin
to very many in both countries.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The French bourgeois
</span>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in the
middle of the eighteenth century was the starting-point
from which began a remarkable commercial prosperity
in France.  It was a prosperity of the bourgeois, the
burghers or dwellers in the towns, who developed the
industries and trades, but it did not reach down to
the paysans, the peasants or dwellers in the country.
They were in a very bad way, ground down by heavy
taxes and by the enforced labour demanded from them
by the seigneurs, or landowners.
</p>

<p>
France had expected great things from her
Compagnie de l'Occident, and her extensive colony
of Louisiana; but the trading stations which she
established in increasing number in the East brought
her far richer gains.  The war of the Austrian Succession
engaged England and France in fighting on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
battlefields as far apart as Canada and Louisiana in the West,
and India in the East; and in the East the French,
under Dupleix, at first had the advantage again and
again.  They repulsed an attack of the English on
Pondicherry and they captured Madras.  Indications,
for the moment, pointed towards an Indian Empire
for France as far more likely than an English Indian
Empire.  In the West, England fared better, but the
results of the victories of either side were largely
neutralised by that far-reaching Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
which provided that both should relinquish
their recent conquests to the other.  So the apparent
effect of that far-off fighting was to show England
increasing in strength westward, but losing, relatively
to France, in the East.  The events of the next few
years were to prove that appearance true for the West,
but completely to disprove it in the East.  And we
should note here once again that it was mainly on the
sea-coasts of India, not inland, that the French
established themselves.  In the interior, the great
empire of the Moguls was passing from its zenith of
power.  The most remarkable monument to its glory
is that surpassingly beautiful Taj Mahal, regarded as
one of the world's wonders&mdash;the shrine erected by the
Mogul emperor in memory of his best beloved wife.
And as the Mogul supremacy wanes, the power of the
Hindu States of Mahratta and Sindhia increases, so
that the balance is nearly equal between the
Mahommedans and the Buddhists.

<p>
The little kingdom of Afghanistan which we have
seen rise on the north-eastern frontier of India
established its complete independence towards the
middle of the century, after long fighting, with varying
fortune, against Persia.  On her other boundary,
westward and northward, Persia was engaged, on the
whole successfully, in perpetual fighting against the
Turk; but the result, except as it indicated a decrease
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
in Turkey's striking force, had little or no effect on the
Great Story.  Under the famous Shah Nadir, Persian
armies had penetrated as far eastward as Delhi.
But after Nadir's death, in 1747, his eastern conquests
were lost.
</p>

<p>
On its north-western border, India was menaced
by Chinese armies, that conquered the warlike Ghurkas
and subdued Nepal.  At no other moment of our story
does China appear so successful or so aggressive in
arms or so likely to play an important part in the world
drama.  Her great emperor Keenlung had come to the
throne in 1735, commencing a reign of no less than sixty
years.  Nor even then did he leave the throne to die,
but voluntarily relinquished it to his son&mdash;to the
fifteenth, in seniority, of his many sons.
</p>

<p>
This, however, was the farthest limit of Chinese
extension in the direction of India.  The Ghurkas, a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
tribe of martial hill-men destined to distinguished
service under the British flag in later years, soon regained
their independence.  China contented herself with a
much disputed sovereignty over the more northern
province of Tibet.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR
</h3>

<p>
It is likely that until the latter half of the eighteenth
century the people of Europe did not even begin to
realise the full meaning of the great New World which
Columbus had discovered for them in the West.  Spain
regarded it as a Tom Tiddler's ground where she would
go and pick up gold.  France and possibly England
too had their foolish dreams.  They expected enormous
things from that vast continent of which the western
limits were only gradually revealed to them.  They
expected enormous results which never were, nor ever
could be realised.  But they had no idea whatever
of the yet more enormous effect which the finding of
the new continent really was to have on the story.
All that was hidden from their eyes.
</p>

<p>
The settlement between the nations agreed at
Aix-la-Chapelle was called a "Peace," but it was a
settlement that left one of the States of Europe in a
situation which did not promise that the peace would
last long.  That State was Prussia.  We have seen
her establishing herself and gaining strength.  She had
taken Silesia from Austria, and Austria had agreed
to that loss in the terms of the peace, but yet longed
for an opportunity to regain the loss.  France and Spain
were knit together in an alliance known as the Family
Compact, because the rulers of both countries were of the
Bourbon family.  Austria, under Maria Theresa, joined
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
their family alliance, and brought in Saxony with her,
for Saxony was no less jealous of the power of Prussia
than Austria herself.  Russia, under the Tsarina
Elizabeth, was anxious about the growing strength of
this Teutonic State on her border; and on her side
she brought Sweden into the large conspiracy which had
for its object the break up of the power of Prussia and
a partition between the conspirators of the Prussian
territories.
</p>

<p>
It was a conspiracy which came to the knowledge
of Frederick, the Prussian king.
</p>

<p>
For many years the interests of England and of
France had been in conflict both West and East, in
America and in India.  The opposition was approaching
the point at which war must result from it.  Now,
in the European position just indicated, England saw
the opportunity of getting a strong helper against
France.  She allied herself with Frederick, who had
carried the States of Brunswick and of Hesse-Cassel
with him; and together they declared war upon nearly
all Europe.  France, Austria, Spain, Russia, Sweden,
and Saxony were against them.
</p>

<p>
It has the sound of a combination of overwhelming
force as opposed to the English and the Prussian kings,
even though the immense power of Russia was then
only in its infancy.  England was not likely to send
very large armies to the Continent, and an English
force of 50,000 retreated before the French and was
disbanded very early in the war.  But Frederick had
a genius for the creation and organisation of armies,
and had occupied it, during the eight years following
the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in making the Prussian
army the finest military machine which the modern
world had seen.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Seven Years' War
</span>
</p>

<p>
The war which ensued, known as the Seven Years'
War from the time that it lasted, is most remarkable
for its dramatic changes of fortune.  Frederick began
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
by a victory in Saxony, yet more than once he was so
heavily defeated that he almost gave up the fight in
despair.  It is said that he thought of suicide.  England,
when the elder Pitt was Prime Minister, gave assistance
in form of large subsidies of money rather than large
forces of men or arms, and without these subsidies
Frederick must have given in.  A mixed force of
English and Hanoverians did indeed fight under the
Duke of Brunswick and drove back the French from
their attacks on Hanover in 1758 and again in 1759,
but except for this last success everything went heavily
against Frederick in the fourth year of the war.  In
the year following, contingents of Russian and Austrian
armies were actually occupying Berlin when he fell
upon the main Austrian force at Torgau on the Elbe.
The victory that he there gained, over heavy odds,
turned the tide of the fighting in his favour when it was
at its lowest ebb.
</p>

<p>
Still the struggle continued, with Frederick and his
war-weary troops chiefly on the defensive, exhausted.
And to that exhaustion and to his encircling foes he
would in all likelihood have been compelled to own
defeat, had it not been for the death at the beginning
of 1762 of one of his chief enemies, the Tsarina of
Russia, and the accession of a Tsar who was his friend.
Russia, from a foe became an ally and carried Sweden
with her.  England, however, had become tired of
the war and made alliance with France and Spain by
the Peace of Paris in 1763, and in the same year the
protagonists, or chief fighters, Prussia and Austria,
themselves came to terms.  Prussia retained Silesia.
The final result of the seven years' fighting, with these
singular alternations of victories and defeats, was to
leave the map of Europe practically unchanged.  From
that point of view all the bloodshed had been for
nothing.
</p>

<p>
From another, a larger and more just point of view,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
however, we are obliged to realise that perhaps no other
one war in the whole of the story has made more
difference to its future course.  If we consider its
effect on the Continent alone, we must realise that it
laid the foundation on which the union of the German
States into a compact nation was later to be built.  It
established Prussia in far greater strength than before,
because, if she had not added to her possessions, she
had at least held her own while her enemies vainly
dashed themselves against her.  Austria had perforce
to acquiesce at length in the loss of Silesia and also in
the recognition of this strong State of Northern
Germany set up against her own strength in the south.
Prussia was to prove the nucleus round and under
which the unity of Germany should be built, and it
was this war which set firm the foundations of that
building.
</p>

<p>
And as to who was the master mason in that building
we can have no doubt whatever.
</p>

<p>
We have come across many men in course of this
Greatest Story to whom the title of Great has been
given, but surely to none more rightly than to this
great King of Prussia.  His courage in the hour of defeat
has been indicated by the above very brief sketch of
the war.  It was only by the most steadfast courage
combined with rare military genius that he came out
of that seven years' fighting unshattered.  But his
genius served his country in peaceful as well as warlike
interests.  He was an absolute despot, yet he used
himself and his despotic power entirely for his country's
good.  He set the example, in his own court, of a rigid,
a scraping economy.  He did all in his power to develop
the industries of the country, by road making, by
improved means of transport, and by every possible
expedient.  He encouraged education and brought men
of letters like Voltaire to the Prussian court.  He was
rough and passionate, but a very hard worker, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
all his work was given to the strengthening and
enlightening of his subjects.
</p>

<p>
Taken from this point of view, then, the Seven
Years' War is seen to have had a very great effect on
our story.
</p>

<p>
But let us regard it also in its effects on the far
larger stage upon which the story is being enacted, now
that the Old East and the New West have begun to
form part of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The War overseas
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the very same year, 1757, that Frederick gained
two of his most effective victories, those of Rosbach
and of Leuthen, in the first of which he broke up the
French armies and in the second the armies of Austria,
England was gaining success no less important against
France far overseas.  We have spoken of the East
India Company of merchants settled as traders in
various places along the coasts of India.  It was
thus, establishing stations on the coast, that the
Portuguese, first, had come; and so too the French
and English after them.  Already, before the Seven
Years' War, we have also noticed sundry clashes of
arms between the English and the French, in which
the advantage had gone heavily against the former.
Both nations were obliged to keep a certain force of
troops under arms for their protection in a country
where the friendship of the natives was uncertain.
The natives were of various races; the land was
divided between many rulers of different States; and
there was the one outstanding division of religion
between Hindus and Mahommedans.
</p>

<p>
It may seem a strange thing to say, but really it
was the French ambition to found a French Empire
in India which led to the foundation of the British
Empire.  Under their able and ambitious leader,
Dupleix, the French began to push inland from their
coastal stations and forcibly to claim authority in some
of the native States.  It was, of course, an authority
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
which they exercised in favour of their own people
and against the English traders.  When the Seven
Years' War broke out, English and French in India
as elsewhere were declared and open enemies.  It was
at this very moment that the Nawab, the native
ruler, of Bengal, began to quarrel with the English.
Naturally he was supported by the French.  At first
things went badly for the English in some fighting
which led to no decisive result, but in the following
year&mdash;the year of Rosbach and of Leuthen&mdash;the
British, under Clive, gained a victory of the greatest
importance over the troops of the Nawab, supported
by the French, at Plassey.
</p>

<p>
It seems to have been quite a revelation to the
natives that the British were able to fight at all, and
from this time forward their prestige was established
in the East, The battle which mainly decided the
issue, as between English and French, was not fought
until three years later, for at Plassey there had been
only a few French supporting the native forces.  But
at Wandewash, in 1760, the battle was between British
and French almost wholly, and its result was a decisive
British victory.  From that time forward Britain was
always regarded as the principal European power in
India and on all the eastern sea-coasts.
</p>

<p>
That was the mark made in the East on this greatest
of all stories by the Seven Years' War.
</p>

<p>
Its mark was planted no less deeply on the western
side.  Montreal and Quebec were French towns at
the beginning of the war.  Moreover, Montcalm, the
French governor, had established the authority of the
French, supported by a chain of forts, right away
west as far as the Mississippi.  Take out the atlas, and,
remembering that the French possession of Louisiana
at that time stretched right up from New Orleans at
the Mississippi's mouth to the Great Lakes, you will
realise what this meant to the British people in America.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
It meant that they were completely hemmed in and
shut off from all access to the West.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Canada gained by England
</span>
</p>

<p>
Pitt seems to have realised it.  He sent out a strong
force, which was ably helped by the militia called up
from the British who were settled in America.  Montcalm
appears to have shown much genius for friendship
with the Indians, and he had many of their tribes to
aid his French forces.  But the British gained post
after post, and the crowning victory was won by
Wolfe in 1759 on the Plains of Abraham, which
dominate Quebec.  Canada was won for Great Britain.
The way to the almost boundless West was opened
to men of British race.  France's dream of Western
empire was broken as completely as her dream of empire
in the East.  Florida, moreover, became British under
the terms of the Peace of Paris, being assigned to Great
Britain in return for Cuba and the Philippine Islands
which had been taken from the Spaniards during the
war.
</p>

<p>
1760, the year of the Wandewash battle in India,
saw two great battles in Europe, one on land, at Minden,
and one on sea, in Quiberon Bay, in both of which the
French were heavily beaten.  They happened at a
moment when Frederick's fortunes were at low ebb,
and were sorely needed.  In the land battles the French
were broken by a charge of the English line which
seems to have been delivered contrary to all then
recognised rules of war.  At sea the French fleet was
practically destroyed by the English under Admiral
Hawke just when it was actually preparing for an
invasion of England.
</p>

<p>
And the rewards of these conquests, both East and
West, were confirmed to Britain by that Peace of Paris
which terminated the Seven Years' War.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
HOW THE UNITED STATES WON INDEPENDENCE
</h3>

<p>
We have come to a moment in our story at which
the events which modified it most importantly occurred,
not in Europe at all, but in that new West which was
still British.  Before considering them, however, it
will be well to gather up some loose ends of the
European story.
</p>

<p>
There had been some rearrangement of territory, in
the year 1767, between Denmark and Sweden, by which
most of what we may see on modern maps marked
as Schleswig-Holstein was given over to Denmark
in exchange for the Duchy of Oldenburg; but a
rearrangement of far more importance was that which
is known as the first partition of Poland in 1772.  It
was a mutual arrangement, between the three strong
powers of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, to dismember
and embody as parts of themselves such pieces of
Polish territory as lay most neighbourly to their own
boundaries.
</p>

<p>
The Seven Years' War had been in large measure
brought about by a rather similar design against
Prussia and Poland seems to have been one of the
consenting parties, if not an active partaker, in that
proposed robbery.  Now a robbery yet more audacious
was not only proposed but actually perpetrated upon
her.  She was powerless to resist; though there
had been a time when she was a great power and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
Russia was scarcely heard of, Austria no more than
the boundary buffer state between the Teuton and
the Slav, and Prussia of no account whatever in the
story.  This first partition was followed by a second
and yet a third rather more than twenty years
afterwards.  By that latest division she was almost wholly
swallowed up in Russia and ceased to exist as an
independent State until her comparatively recent
resuscitation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Expansion of Russia
</span>
</p>

<p>
On whatever side we now look of the boundaries of
Russia we see them continuously extending.  Her
armies defeat the Tartars eastward, the Turks
southward; she destroys a large Turkish fleet; she gains
the extensive region called White Russia, and the
Crimea, and sends conquering armies into the Balkan
States, where the Bulgarian Slavs are establishing
themselves ever more firmly as an independent nation.
Largely it is by reason of the growing power of Russia
that the Turks, are more and more compelled to fight
for their existence and for their hold on even a part of
their wide conquests in Europe.  They are no longer
fighting to extend them.  And at the same time, that
is to say, in 1768, Egypt, under the Mamelukes, throws
off the domination of the Ottomans.  Originally these
Mamelukes themselves were Turkish&mdash;a bodyguard
of Turkish slaves enrolled for the protection of the
Egyptian rulers.  They had revolted and seized the
government soon after the reign of Saladin.  And it is
worthy of note that in the midst of all the fighting
which goes on in and around the Balkans between
Venetians, Turks, Russians, and others, the little
mountain State of Montenegro always retains her
independence.  Though often attacked, she is never
subdued.  Her story may remind us of those valiant
and invincible Swiss, for doubtless it is because of the
mountainous character of the two countries alike,
giving the defence such a great advantage over the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
attack, that the heroic defenders of both kept their
homeland free against enemies whose numbers were
many times greater than their own.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Now, turning to the far western side of the stage,
the leading feature of the drama is that the British had
established themselves as the great power in America.
They had little to fear now from the French.  And the
reason why that fact is of such vast importance in the
story is that, had it not been for that freedom from
the French menace, the independence of the United
States could not possibly have been won as, and at the
time when, it was won.  We may regard that independence
as a good thing or a bad thing for the world:
we may think it better for the world that there should
be this great free nation in the West, not united by any
political ties with Europe; or we may, on the
contrary, deem that the peace and prosperity of man
would be better served if the United States belonged
to that confederation of States which we call the
British Empire&mdash;although "Empire" is rather a
misleading name for it.  The voice of the Anglo-Saxon
communities would certainly speak even more forcibly
than it does in the world's counsels if there were such
union and such unity.
</p>

<p>
But, whatever view we may take as to that, we
cannot but see that the English settlers in America
could never, with even tolerable safety, have declared
themselves independent of the British Government,
if they had still had the French menace hanging over
them.  They could not possibly have dispensed with
the support of the British army and navy.  But after
the defeat of the French in Canada they were free to
assert themselves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
George III
</span>
</p>

<p>
And again whatever be our opinion about this great
splitting up into two branches of the Anglo-Saxon
stock, we of England are painfully obliged to realise
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
that it was England's fault.  It came about owing to
the obstinacy and the despotic ideas of that king of the
Hanoverian Royal family, George III., who was on the
throne of Great Britain.  He even tried his hardest,
but in vain, to suppress the newspapers which dared
to comment on matters of public interest at home.
As a foreigner, and very ignorant of the temper of the
people, he was in some degree to be excused.  He
could scarcely be expected to know better than
he did.
</p>

<p>
There were those about him whom we might have
expected to know better&mdash;his Prime Ministers, and
notably Lord Grenville and Lord North.  But Lord
Grenville was as proud and arrogant as the king
himself, and Lord North was not at all a clever man, and,
besides, was the absolute servant of his king, not
daring to assert his voice against his master's, as Pitt,
who had been Prime Minister a little while before, had
dared often and long.
</p>

<p>
We have to realise that the actual government was
very much in the hands of the king at this date.
Then, as now, it was nominally the Parliament that
governed.  The Cabinet, in fact, does most of the
business to-day.  Under George III. it was George
III. that governed, because the Parliament was full of
"the king's friends," as they were called&mdash;members
whom affection or bribery or some other form of
interest influenced so that they could be relied on to
support any measures which the king wished to be
carried.
</p>

<p>
The population and the wealth of the British colonies
in America had grown very rapidly.  At the beginning
of George III.'s reign the colonists are said to have
numbered nearly a million and a half, which was then
just about a fourth of the population of the mother
country.  And there was already half a million of
slaves in the South.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
</p>

<p>
The slaves were already creating a difference
between the South and the North, or, shall we say,
were emphasising and widening the difference created
by the different type of colonist by which the two
districts were populated.  For Virginia and the other
southern States had been occupied largely by emigrants
from the West of England and by aristocratic
families, and with the slaves to work for them they
tended to divide up the country into large estates;
whereas in the North, whither the emigrants had
come from a lower social stratum at home, and where
they had no slaves to work for them, the holdings
were small.
</p>

<p>
In religion the Virginians were mainly of the
Established English Church.  In Maryland, the
inhabitants were chiefly Roman Catholic.  In New
England, Puritans were in a large majority; and in
Pennsylvania, the State of William Penn, the people
were largely Quakers.
</p>

<p>
It was for the sake of religion that most of them, or
their forbears, had left their native land.  And
just because the religions were so many and various,
it was impossible that there could be any established
Church among them in the land of their adoption.
Men were free to serve God according to the dictates
of their consciences.
</p>

<p>
Each State was governed by an Assembly elected
by its own people and by a Governor appointed by the
Crown.  The States had their "charters"&mdash;documents
in which were drawn up their rights and their duties&mdash;and
so long as they acted within the provisions of those
characters the Governor had no right or reason to
interfere.  The right of taxing themselves for the
purpose of administering their own affairs was given
them.  The home Government derived a revenue from
the colonies by the duties charged on articles which
they imported by sea.  And the colonies were obliged
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
by their charters to engage in no trade overseas except
with the home country.
</p>

<p>
This last provision had not been faithfully observed,
and a considerable trade was going on illicitly between
the British and the Spanish colonies.  Britain, short
of money by reason of the cost of the Seven Years'
War, raised the import duties and enforced the
prohibition against trading with the Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
Certain of the expenses of the war had been incurred
for the protection of the colonies, and though they
might not welcome this action of the home Government
they could not legally resist it.  Nor did they.  But
then the king and his minister Grenville imposed, or
sought to impose, on them a tax which surely was
illegal and which surely they were within their rights
in resisting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Stamp Act
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was imposed by the piece of legislation known
as the Stamp Act, because its object was to levy money
from the colonists by making it illegal for them to
buy and sell certain articles within the colonies
themselves unless they bore a government stamp; for
which stamp payment had to be made to the home
Government.
</p>

<p>
It was a manifest breach of the agreement which
had been made with the colonists, and the principal
effect of the passing of this Stamp Act in 1765 was
that the colonists called together a Congress of delegates
from all the colonies and passed a protest against the
Act and a demand for its repeal.  More than that;
when the ship came into Boston harbour carrying
the first batch of the stamps to be used for the new tax,
they had the stamps seized and retained.  It was open
defiance.  It was defiance by something like three
millions of determined people, the population having
nearly doubled itself since the beginning of George III.'s
reign.  Pitt's generous comment upon it is well
known: "Three millions of people so dead to all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves,
would have been fit instruments to make slaves of the
rest."
</p>

<p>
It was chiefly Pitt's influence which led to the repeal
of the Act in 1766; but much of the good effect of its
repeal must have been spoiled by a measure called
the "Declaratory Act," passed at the same time,
declaring that the power of the British Parliament
was supreme over the colonies "in all cases
whatsoever."  It was as much as to say, "We yield on this
particular point, but we maintain that our right over
you is despotic whensoever we think fit to exercise
it."  It did, in fact, claim to enslave, as Pitt indicated,
these people, because, as we have seen all through the
story, it was by insistence on the right to tax themselves
that Britons had painfully won liberty: it was a right
expressed in the words "no taxation without
representation": and here was a declaration directly
opposed to that right, for it declared that the home
Government might tax the colonists, although they had
no representation in the home Government!
</p>

<p>
But for the moment the trouble passed.  The
colonists had all the substance of victory in the repeal
of the Stamp Act: they could afford to disregard the
shadowy threat of the Declaratory Act.  They may
have thought that, since the king and Parliament had
yielded to their resistance once, they were not likely
to challenge that resistance again.  But King George
appears to have been incapable of learning.  Seven
years later the trouble broke out anew, again provoked
by the question of taxation.  The colonists protested
against import duties which they considered illegal
and oppressive, and their protest was met by the
withdrawal of all the duties objected to except that on
tea.  They accepted this withdrawal, and this
exception, amicably; but they countered the
exception by generally refusing to drink tea, so that no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
tea was imported and no duty on it was payable.  It
was a situation which would be laughable if the
consequences had not been so tragic.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Opposition to the tea duty
</span>
</p>

<p>
Despite the non-tea-drinking resolution, English
ships laden with tea put into Boston harbour towards
the end of 1773, doubtless with a view to landing
it.  Whether or no it would have been landed we can
never know, for the ships while in harbour were
boarded by a mob disguised as wild Indians and all
the tea-chests were thrown into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Again it would be laughable but for the tragic
consequence.  The colonial Governments deplored the
lawless act and were ready to make compensation.
But the king, who had ever bewailed what he called
"the fatal compliance" in the repeal of the Stamp
Act, would accept no expression of regret.  Measures
were introduced into Parliament for closing the port
of Boston to all commerce, by way of punishment for
the act of "hooliganism," as we now should call it, and
virtually all the liberties granted by charter to the
State of Massachusetts, of which Boston was the chief
city, were withdrawn.  Troops were sent out to enforce
these decrees, and the general in command was
appointed Governor of the State with powers such as
had never before been vested in any governor of any
American colony.
</p>

<p>
The citizens of Massachusetts refused to obey the
enactments of the Governor, and all the colonies in
America sooner or later came to the support of
Massachusetts.  And that is no matter for our wonder,
seeing that they must have felt that what was done
to Massachusetts to-day might be done to them
to-morrow.  They must quickly have realised that
their best hope of liberty lay in opposing a united front
to the servitude that threatened them.  It might seem
but a slender hope; yet we may remember that those
colonists of a new world were far more apt to make
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
good fighters than agriculturists or townsfolk in a
long settled land.  They were still surrounded by
hostile tribes of Red Indians.  Many of themselves,
and most of their forefathers, must have lived with
rifle ever ready at hand, for protection against sudden
attack, while they went about their tasks of peace.
They were doubtless quick-witted, as men needs must
be who are constantly facing new conditions.  They
were tough, determined men, and in their struggle to
be free they found a man to lead them&mdash;George
Washington.
</p>

<p>
Of their tough quality the British soldiers made
experience in the first serious clash of arms at Bunker's
Hill.  I cannot tell you, in a story of barest outlines
like this, the details of the long drawn-out fighting,
how the cause of the colonists' freedom seemed now
and again all but lost, how the fortunes of the war went
this way and that.  For its changes were scarcely
less remarkable than those of the Seven Years' War
in Europe.  The quality that served the colonists
best and enabled them to win through was that
essentially British quality of refusing to believe
themselves defeated.  They endured with an extraordinary
steadfastness and they recovered themselves
when beaten to the ground with a marvellous resilience.
</p>

<p>
Even after fighting had begun, a reconciliation
might have been made had the counsels of Lord
Chatham prevailed at home.  George Washington
was representative of the great landowners of Virginia.
By their traditions, and also owing to the fact that
their state lay far south of that Massachusetts which
was the immediate sufferer by the British tyranny,
the Virginians clung more closely and longer to the
mother country than any of the other colonial children.
But their clinging was of no use.  Chatham's good
counsel was rejected.  Washington, as leader of the
nation in war, was probably the more looked up to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
because he had tried so hard for peace.  His face now
was set as firmly towards the prosecution of the war
as it had been towards peace while any hope of
favourable peace was left.  And every year of the war's
duration revealed more and more his rare character
for wisdom, determination, and moderation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Course of the War
</span>
</p>

<p>
A solemn and formal declaration of the independence
of the United States of America was made on
July 4th, 1776, but all that year and the greater part
of the next the fighting went hardly for the colonists
until, in October, 1777, the British under Burgoyne
suffered their first serious&mdash;and it was very
serious&mdash;defeat at Saratoga.
</p>

<p>
It was a disaster to the British arms which had
far-reaching effects.  France was still seething with
discontent over the loss of colonies in the Seven Years'
War.  Now, encouraged by the event of Saratoga,
she declared war on Great Britain.  Spain shortly
followed her lead.  And in the same year Lord Chatham
died.  A little later Holland took the side of the enemies
of Great Britain also, provoked by the claims of
Britain to search the ships of neutral nations for arms
or other "contraband of war" which they might be
carrying for the Americans.  Sweden, Russia, and
Denmark united in an "armed neutrality" compact
against her, to enforce the freedom of the seas and the
right which they claimed for their ships to cross the
ocean without liability to be searched.
</p>

<p>
A further effect of Saratoga was that the British
armies took the field no more in the northern States,
but concentrated in the south.  There they held their
own, if not more than their own, until in 1781 a second
blow, even more calamitous than that of Saratoga,
befell them.  The generals in command of the sections
of the British did not work in harmony.  Lord
Cornwallis was disappointed in the support which
he had expected, and entrenched himself behind
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
defensive lines in York Town in Virginia.  The French
fleet held the sea.  Washington marched round and
cut him off from supplies by land.  He was driven by
famine to surrender, with all his army.
</p>

<p>
It was the end of the war.  It was the establishment,
never again to be shaken, of the independence
of the United States of America.  It looked grievously
like the end of Great Britain as a leading power in the
world.  Ireland rose against her in a clamour for what
virtually was independence, Spain claimed Gibraltar
as the price of peace, and France demanded that Great
Britain should give over to her the greater part of
British India.
</p>

<p>
Then, in that very dark hour for England, deliverance
came, as more than once before, from the sea.
Lord Rodney had already struck a disabling blow at a
main portion of the Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent;
and now, in 1782, he dealt what really was a shattering
stroke on the French fleet in the West Indies.  These
naval victories and the repulse of the French and
Spanish ships beleaguering Gibraltar disposed those
nations to agree to terms of peace in which England
could acquiesce without dishonour.  She lost nothing
to France; to Spain she resigned the island of Minorca
and gave back Florida; and&mdash;she lost the United
States.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
HOW THE STAGE WAS SET FOR THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
</h3>

<p>
Thus England's star went setting in the West; but in
the East coincidentally it rose continuously to greater
glory.  Plassey had given Bengal into her hands;
Wandewash had made her authority dominant in
Southern India.  But as yet it was not England, the
nation and the King of England, that held this scarcely
defined authority.  It was the great trading concern
known as the East India Company.
</p>

<p>
"Some have greatness thrust upon them"; and
this was remarkably true of the empire of India which
Great Britain was really compelled by the force of
circumstances to assume.  The trading company did
not desire to govern the country: they wished to
fulfil their original purpose of trade, of making money.
It was the aggression of the French and the oppression
of the native ruler of Bengal, as we have seen, which
obliged them to fight for the very liberty to trade.
Further, they were compelled to maintain some kind
of order in the districts in which they thus became
supreme.  It was not easy for them to do this under
their charter as traders.  The government of the
native princes of Bengal was inefficient and corrupt
and the people under them were in misery.  An Act of
the British Parliament in 1773 appointed a Governor-General
with powers over all the British possessions in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
India.  Warren Hastings, a civilian in the Company's
service, was the first to hold that high post, and with
a strong hand he reduced to nothing the powers of the
worst of the native rulers and made the government of
the better among them less ineffective and corrupt.
With the rulers of some of the independent States
he entered into treaties and alliances.  The idea of
Britain's Indian Empire seems to have been born in
the brain of Warren Hastings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Warren Hastings
</span>
</p>

<p>
And the peculiar conditions of India made the
realisation of that idea not only possible but inevitable.
Through the whole of her story Hindustan has been a
land of constant strife between various races settled on
her soil and between those settled races and warlike
tribes coming down upon her from the north through
the passes of her great boundary mountains, the
Himalayas.  But the greatest cleavage of all among her
people was that which still exists between the Moslems
and the Hindus of the Buddhist faith.  All the many
divisions have been causes of jealousies and fighting, but
none so constant and prolonged as those due to these
two opposed faiths.  It is that opposition, in the main,
which has made the British Empire in India both
possible and necessary&mdash;possible, because without
that cleavage there might well have been a union of
native strength sufficient to withstand the British
domination, and necessary, because at every step the
British found their trade and their peace imperilled
by disturbances beyond the latest limits within which
they had made good their authority.  They were
impelled, for their own mere safety, to push that
authority further and further again.  And it was a
necessity imposed on them also by consideration for
the sufferings of the natives in some of the worst
governed States.  It was a veritable "white man's
burden" laid, of no will of their own, and sometimes
sorely against their will, upon their shoulders.

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
</p>

<p>
Warren Hastings had to stand a prolonged trial
on his return home for what almost certainly were
acts of exceeding harshness in his dealings with some of
the native rulers.  He was acquitted; and it is not
possible for us now to try him over again.  Almost
certainly he dealt very hardly; but almost as certainly
no man who did not deal very hardly could have done
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
what he did to bring a large part of India under a
government which gave its subjects greater peace
and happiness than they had known before.
</p>

<p>
As we know, there was another power besides the
French with which Great Britain came into collision
in the East&mdash;the Dutch.  Ever since the middle of the
eighteenth century there had been much ill-will in
Holland against England.  Holland only a little while
before had been the chief naval power in the Northern
seas.  Her ships had even come conquering and
destroying far up the Thames.  And now the Dutch
saw that supremacy gradually taken from them; the
British Government actually passing resolutions to
restrain their free right of traffic on the high seas.
And at the same time Great Britain was taking much,
and constantly more and more, of the carrying trade
away from Holland; Great Britain was trading more
and more, on her own behalf and on that of other
nations, with the East; Great Britain was bringing
to the West, from her ever-growing Eastern possessions,
the produce of the East which used to be brought
from the Dutch colonies in Dutch ships; some of these
colonies and trading settlements themselves were
being taken from the Dutch by the British; and where
the Dutch rights were not very firmly established
British traders set up settlements to compete with
them.
</p>

<p>
A state of actual war between the countries existed
from 1780 to 1784.  The terms of the treaty which
put an end to that active warfare could not put an end
to their constant trade rivalry in the East in which
Great Britain was usually the gainer and Holland the
loser.  By the date of the great convulsions caused by
the French Revolution we find Holland so diminished
in power as to be ready to do the bidding of Great
Britain and of Prussia.
</p>

<p>
It was thus that Britain's star rose higher and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
brighter in the East even as it sank in the West, and if we
look to the far southern quarter of the world stage we
find it in the ascendant there also, for in 1787 New
Zealand was declared a British possession, and that
declaration was followed in the next year by the
colonisation of New South Wales.  The beginning of the
British occupation of the west coast of Africa dates
from the same time.  On every side therefore, except
along that eastern fringe of the American continent
where the colonists had gloriously won their independence,
the British, the Anglo-Saxons, were extending
their sway.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Poyning's Act Repealed
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was one people, British yet not Anglo-Saxon,
very, much nearer the home centre, who made a bold
claim, and in part a successful claim, at this moment
for their independence&mdash;the Irish.  By a law of
George I., known as Poyning's Act, from its proposer,
no measure passed by the Parliament of Ireland could
become law until it had received the assent of the King
of England.  It was this law of which the Irish, under
the lead of Grattan, their great orator, obtained the
repeal in the year 1782, taking advantage of the dire
straits in which England then found herself.  It needs
but a moment's thought to show that this repeal meant
all the difference between a dependent and an
independent Parliament in Ireland.  It put Irishmen into
the position that they were free to legislate in all Irish
matters without interference from England.  Irishmen
in large numbers had before this emigrated to
America, and naturally had been active in inflaming
the anti-English feeling in the colonies.  Besides
all political reasons, and the real grievances under
which the Irish had suffered from the English, the fact
that the great majority of them were Catholics was an
added occasion why these people of a Celtic origin
could not be at rest under the government of the
Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Church of Rome in Ireland
</span>
</p>

<p>
The political power of the Church of Rome, that is
to say, the power of the Pope to interfere in the
government, had received some severe checks even in the
countries where Roman Catholicism was the religion
of the State.  As early as 1753 the Pope had yielded
to the King of Spain the power to make appointments
to the high dignities in the Church; but still the
Romish Church meddled with politics abroad.  Such
interference was resented by the despotic kings of the
Bourbon branch of the great Capet stock, both in
France and Spain.  The political activities of the very
able and energetic order of Jesuits gave special offence
to the Governments.  Portugal had commenced the
campaign against them by driving them out as early
as 1759.  In France their activities were suppressed
five years later.  In 1767 they were expelled from Spain,
and within a very few years such pressure was put upon
the Pope that he was obliged to break up their order in
Italy itself.  We have seen how Spain was ground
beneath the heel of the Inquisition&mdash;not acting under
orders from Rome but on its own initiative.  Now,
that is to say, in 1774, the Spanish Government asserted
itself to confine the judicial power of the Inquisition
to ecclesiastical cases; that is to say, that its officials
might only arrest and try and punish the people
guilty, or suspected of guilt, against the laws of the
Church.  Before that, it had been in the habit of
arresting and trying and punishing persons suspected of
breaking the common law of the land, the civil law.
The Inquisition's claim to try these civil cases had been
without legal warrant, but the Government had not till
now found the courage to resist it.  And this withdrawal
of all such cases out of the hands of the Inquisition
gave a blow that was really deadly to the power of
that cruel and dreaded institution, though it was not
finally abolished until nearly half a century later.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in all these strongholds of the Roman
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
Catholic faith the political activity of the Church was
checked.  It received no such check, however, in
Ireland.  That island was as true a stronghold of the
old faith as any of those others and had escaped, as
they had not, much, both of the darkening of the faith
in the Middle Ages, and also of the storms that shook
it in the Reformation.  Rome's authority received no
check from any Government in Ireland, because it
had never come up against the authority of an Irish
Government.  During the years in which other
Governments were growing restive under the political
interference of the Church, and latterly of the Jesuits more
particularly, there was no independent Government in
Ireland, and the native leaders of Ireland were ready
enough to welcome any form of interference with
England's Government.  For this reason the Church
continued to be politically active in Ireland&mdash;always
in opposition to Protestant England&mdash;without arousing
the hostility to which it had been obliged to yield in
other Catholic countries.
</p>

<p>
And now the course of this Greatest Story has
brought us to the years in which the centre of the stage
begins to be occupied by the tragic figure of France
struggling in the throes of her revolution.  Even at
that time, although communication was comparatively
very difficult and slow, the tremors of the revolution
were felt over nearly all the world stage.  Temporarily
it changed the map of Europe beyond recognition.
And not only temporarily, but for all time, it changed
the minds of men not only in Europe, but nearly the
whole world over.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE REVOLUTION AND THE TERROR
</h3>

<p>
The position in Europe at this time, that is to say,
about 1790, was singular and interesting.  That
continent, always since the establishment of the power
of Rome the stage on which the principal world drama
was played, was in the enjoyment of a peace which
was unexpected.  A time of extreme tension, during
which war on a great scale had seemed most probable,
had just been safely passed&mdash;war provoked by the
ambition of Russia still further to extend her vast
territories, and especially to acquire the port of
Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
But first it seemed good to her to proceed to a
second partition of Poland, and Poland lay at her mercy,
unless some foreign power intervened.  Annexation
perhaps would be a better word than partition, for
she had little thought of letting in another to share
with her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Alliance against Rome
</span>
</p>

<p>
Another power, however, namely Prussia, with
Frederick as its king, claimed a share, and drew the
Emperor and King of Austria into alliance with him.
Austria, also, demanded her slice of Polish land, and
in consequence of these conflicting claims, the whole
scheme was allowed to drop for the time being.
</p>

<p>
The next act in the drama was that Prussia and
Austria fell to quarrelling over the latter's proposal
to annex Bavaria, and of that quarrel Russia took
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
advantage to seek the alliance of Austria with the
design of parcelling out between the Russian and the
Austrian powers, the territory of the Turks in Europe
and establishing herself as mistress of Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
Again it was Prussia that stepped in to foil the
scheme, and this time Prussia had once again on her
side her old ally, Great Britain.  The American war
and the formation of that Northern League, as it was
called, of the neutral powers who opposed Great
Britain's claim to search their ships, and so on, had made
a breach of that friendship, for Prussia had been a
member of the League.  But now that trouble was
healed.  The two old allies had come together again
over the business of restoring the Stadholder, the
constitutional ruler, of Holland, who had been driven out by
a revolutionary movement.  Holland also, therefore,
came as a third into the alliance, now reformed, between
Great Britain and Prussia for the special purpose, as
was said, of preserving the Turkish Empire.  The
real motive of the compact was probably to hold Russia
in check; but no doubt the other way of putting
it sounded more unselfish.  A very great struggle
appeared imminent.  But the danger passed, yet again,
as soon as Austria realised the strength of the
opposition.  She withdrew from the war with Turkey, and
Russia, left alone, did not press it.  The war cloud
passed.  Men might again draw their breath freely
after a time of breathless suspense in which the worst
had been expected.  They were free to sit in the
audience and look on at the great events that quickly
followed upon each other in France.
</p>

<p>
In course of telling this greatest of all stories I have
thought it worth to turn aside now and again from
the direct narrative in order to attempt a brief sketch
of the peoples that have played a leading part in it.
The tough tenacity of the Jews, the subtle intellectual
curiosity of the Greeks, the determination and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
directness of purpose of the Romans have been such
important moving forces in the history of the world that they
claim to be considered.  No less consideration is due
at this point to the national character of the French.
It is largely because of that character that the
Revolution took place at all.  It was a Revolution not only
in the government of France, but in the thoughts of
men all over the world.  And it was largely because
of the French national character that Napoleon's
empire, rising out of the ruin wrought by the Revolution,
had force to extend itself even more widely than
that of Charlemagne.
</p>

<p>
We are able to realise something of the qualities
of the national character which had such remarkable
results; but I think we are obliged to confess ourselves
unable to give a very perfect account of the causes
which made it such as it was.  For the French nation,
after all, as its very name implies, is the nation of the
Franks; and the Franks were but one of the many
Gothic tribes which came breaking through the
weakened defences of the later Roman Empire.  Then,
having so broken through, they found themselves in
contact with the settlers already in possession of the
land; and no doubt this contact modified more than a
little the national character which they brought with
them.  Probably most of the settlers whom they would
find, and by whose influence they would be affected,
would be of the Latin race; and therefore the blend
would be in the main a Franco-Latin blend.
</p>

<p>
But this Franco-Latin is really nothing more, as
we have just said, than a Gothic-Latin&mdash;or Germano-Latin,
if you like&mdash;and the other Gothic or German
tribes coming in would be subject to just the same
blend, so far as we can see, and therefore we should
naturally expect to find the same characteristics in
them all.
</p>

<p>
But certainly we do not.  Certainly the Batavians,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
who settled to the northward of the Franks, and the
Burgundians who settled to their westward, did not
show the same blend.  We have seen how the subtlety
of Louis XI. proved too much at last for the audacity
of his great Burgundian vassal, Charles the Bold, and
after Burgundy had become part of the French kingdom
its national characteristics do seem gradually
to have blended nearly into identity with those of
the French.
</p>

<p>
The Visigoths passing on into Spain became subject
to other influences.  They do not come into the comparison.
</p>

<p>
But the Batavians and the peoples of the Netherlands
generally, where the Batavians settled, were
very different from the French.  Doubtless there was
an increasing blend of Latin as the invaders went south,
but an adequate reason for their difference is hard to
find.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The French character
</span>
</p>

<p>
At all events what we can say confidently is that
the French developed, and still express, a national
character of their own which is distinct from that of
the others that broke through the bounds.  It is also
different from that of those German peoples who did
not break through, who remained east of the Roman
Empire's palisades.
</p>

<p>
One distinguishing characteristic of the French is
that they are very "quick at the uptake," as we say:
their minds respond quickly to suggestion, and they
act quickly on the ideas thus quickly grasped.
Thinking and acting more quickly than, say, Britons or
Germans, they also set a much higher value on
presenting to themselves a clear reason for any action
that they undertake.  The Briton, and in less degree
the German, is tolerably well content to do the act
which appears likely to give the best result, without
troubling himself much as to what account he would
give of the action if he were required to explain just
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
why, in accordance with what law of right reason, he
so acted.  The French mind is not at ease unless it
can refer an act back to some such reason as its motive.
And one of the tendencies of that disposition of mind
is that, if the French once perceive a reason of this
kind clearly, they act according to it and are very
readily obedient to its prompting.
</p>

<p>
So it was that when the philosopher Jean Jacques
Rousseau wrote about Egalité, Fraternité, and Liberté,
with the idea that all men were created equal (and
therefore ought to be equal always), that all men ought
to live in brotherly love, and that all men should be
free, these ideas won an immediate influence over the
minds of Frenchmen that they would not have exercised
over the minds of Britons or Germans.  No
doubt they are pleasant ideas, and would be very
welcome, if they could be practically realised, to all
reasonable men of any country; but on the French
their effect was such that the nation at once had an
eager desire to act on them.  Frenchmen deemed that
they might bring about the millennium, or a heaven on
earth, by striving for their realisation.
</p>

<p>
Rousseau, then, and other writers inspired with his
sentiments, prepared the minds of men in France for
revolution.  Many, with an ardour for freedom from
the hard conditions which bound them, went as volunteers
to help the Americans fighting against England.
Those who returned came back with their ardour
further kindled.
</p>

<p>
Now most of the historians write as if the immediate
occasion of the Revolution was the misery, the
oppression, the poverty, and the hunger of the lowest
classes in the towns and in the country.  Yet other
historians, perhaps more judicious, tell us that, evil
as their condition was, it was certainly no worse than
that of the lowest classes elsewhere on the Continent.
Let us admit, at any rate, that it was a cruelly evil
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
condition and left much to be desired.  What was
different in France was the very rigid division between
the classes of society and the fact, noticed before,
that the king had all the real power in his own hands.
The nobles and large landowners had none, except
over their own dependants.
</p>

<p>
Thus there was no link, no connexion, between the
Government and the great mass of the governed: the
governed were dumb; they could not make their
voices heard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The "States General"
</span>
</p>

<p>
The reckless extravagance of three successive
French kings had exhausted the treasury.  Money was
needed for the bare necessities of Government, for the
pay of soldiers and officials.  His ministers having
failed to devise a means of raising the sums required,
the king, Louis XVI., called together the "States
General," a measure to which the Government had
not resorted since the early years of the seventeenth
century.
</p>

<p>
This States General was an assembly of the whole
nation of France represented by deputies elected by
the three great classes, the nobles, the Church, and
the commoners.  Each class elected its own deputies
and sent them up to Paris to take counsel together
and assist the Government in its distress.
</p>

<p>
The deputies of the three estates came to Paris in
1789, and though they did not succeed in finding money
for the Government, they did succeed in finding a voice
for the people.  And it was by this voice that the
Revolution was declared.
</p>

<p>
Trouble began over the manner in which votes were
to be recorded.  The clergy and the nobles demanded
that each estate should give a single vote on any
measure under discussion, and since clergy and nobles
were likely to cast similar votes, the result would then
be that the commoners would be outvoted.  The
commoners demanded that the votes of all three
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
estates should be given in mass, a vote by each deputy.
And since the deputies of the commoners outnumbered
the other two combined, this would give them a
majority.  The clergy and nobles thereupon began
their deliberations and excluded the deputies of the
third estates from the assembly hall.
</p>

<p>
The deputies of the people, thus isolated, went in
a body to the neighbouring tennis court, and there
began their deliberations apart from the deputies of the
other classes.  They assumed the name of the National
Assembly and took an oath not to dissolve until they
had given France a constitution under which men
might live in the desired condition of equality,
brotherhood, and liberty.  They commenced their sitting on
June 20th, 1789.

<br>
THE MODERN PALACE OF VERSAILLES, FRANCE.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
On July 14th the mob of Paris rose, and broke the
walls of the Bastille, the great State prison, loosing the
captives.  The whole city was in their hands.  The
troops within the city were of the same mind as the
mob.
</p>

<p>
Similar risings, with like effects, occurred nearly
all over France.
</p>

<p>
In October the mob marched on Versailles and the
king's palace; they sacked the palace and compelled
the king and Royal family to come to live in Paris,
where they were practically prisoners.
</p>

<p>
The Assembly effected something towards getting
money to carry on with, by printing paper money and
paying the debts of the Government with the notes.
And continually the most violent of the extreme party
gained more and more power in it, most notably the
Jacobins, so called from a club whose members
gathered in what had once been a house of the Jacobin
friars.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1791 the king and Royal family
attempted to escape, secretly, out of France, but were
recognised before they reached the frontier and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
forcibly brought back.  The aristocrats all over the
country had fled from the persecution, or had been
caught in the attempt, and forced to return.  Large
numbers were imprisoned, given a form of trial and
decapitated by the guillotine.  A mob stormed the
Tuileries, where the Royal family were living, and the
king barely escaped with his life.  He implored the
help and mercy of the Assembly, and for the time being
the whole of the Royal family were kept closely
imprisoned.
</p>

<p>
Amidst all these horrors, in the autumn of 1792
a French army showed the first sign of what the
soldiers of revolutionary France could do by the defeat
of a force of Prussians and Austrians marching on
Paris to restore Louis to the throne.  One of the
immediate results was that, early in the following
year, the king was tried for treason and conspiracy
against the nation, was sentenced to death and
beheaded.  He was soon followed to the guillotine by
the queen, his wife.  Their son, styled Louis XVII.,
though he never reigned, died in prison.
</p>

<p>
That was an act which at once bound the enemies
of France into some sort of unity against her.  Hitherto
there had been much division of opinion, in England
especially, about the events of the Revolution.  There
had been sympathy with a people fighting to be
free.
</p>

<p>
The act of king-killing and of queen-killing alienated
all sympathy among the nations ruled by kings.
They made a solid ring around republican France, and
France herself fell more and more into the hands of
the extremists, governing by terror and by executions.
All suspected of sympathy with the aristocrats fell
by the guillotine.  Even the deposed revolutionary
leaders themselves, who had not gone far enough to
please the yet more murderous leaders that followed
them, were arraigned and executed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Reign of Terror, as it was well named, reached
its terrible height when Robespierre was chief man in
the Government, and after he too, failing in an attempt
to commit suicide, had suffered the death to which
he had consigned a thousand others, the murders
committed in the name of justice and patriotism
abated.  The worst of the Terror passed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
France and her foes
</span>
</p>

<p>
So here was this poor vexed country, thus cruelly
misgoverned, ringed round by the kings under arms.
What chance had she?  Perhaps her best chance lay
in the fact that in spite of the misery there was much
enthusiasm in the people.  After Robespierre's death
in 1794 they might draw breath and consider what all
the bloodshed had meant, and they might conclude
that it meant that they had won France for themselves,
for the French people, out of the hands of the king.
Therefore it was their own France, their own country,
that they saw now menaced by the ring of monarchs.
England, Prussia, Austria Spain&mdash;in whichever
direction France looked she saw an enemy.
</p>

<p>
She had, as before in the days of the Habsburg
menace, the advantage of her central position.
Moreover, she had the advantage of one single purpose,
namely, her very existence, over those enemies who,
although they might coalesce against her, yet had their
own rivalries and jealousies.  On the northern frontier,
where the troops of Austria, Prussia, England, and
Holland were gathered, the fortunes of war went badly,
for a time, for France.  There was a moment when the
Allies, if they had shown unity of purpose and
determination, might have marched on Paris with but little
opposition.  Besides the enemy on the frontier, the
republic had her own enemies, who were still in favour
of the monarchy, within, especially in the district of
La Vendée in the west and in some of the large towns of
the south.
</p>

<p>
The indecision of the Allies allowed France a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
breathing space, and she made wonderful use of her
opportunity.
</p>

<p>
We have to realise two points in particular, first
the singular and tragic condition of the French armies
at the moment&mdash;short of pay, short of equipment,
short of seasoned soldiers, and especially short of
experienced leaders, because most of those who should
have led them had been executed or were in prison
expecting execution&mdash;and secondly the fact that the
methods of making war and of fighting battles were
in a transition state, from the old fashion to the
new.
</p>

<p>
The old fashion of fighting had been, roughly
speaking, for the armies to advance in a mass, firing
as they went, until one yielded and fell back or until
they clashed together with the bayonet.  Now the
new method was introduced of keeping a big body of
troops in reserve, to throw in, and so gain a decision
in the battle, after the first encounter of the others.
And gradually that disposition of the troops developed
into the throwing forward of a single line of shooters
in advance of the main body&mdash;skirmishers as they came
to be called, when the thinning of the line was brought
to its extreme.
</p>

<p>
Together with that new way of fighting battles,
there came in a new idea of war.  For the old idea had
been chiefly to capture some important city or fortress
of the enemy, and so to gain a decision in the campaign.
The new idea was that a decision might be most
quickly and convincingly reached by destroying the
enemy's army.  And, with that new idea, the value of
time seems to have been appreciated more fully&mdash;the
importance, that is to say, of arriving in numbers at
a certain place before the enemy could have time to
mass his forces there, and so of beating his armies
piecemeal, before they could be concentrated.
</p>

<p>
As a very rough sketch, that may perhaps serve
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
to give a notion of the way in which war and battles
were changing.
</p>

<p>
It was out of the great danger menacing her very
life as a nation that France was now able to draw new
strength.  The Government passed a decree that all
men of suitable age were liable to conscription to the
army.  They were called on to fight for their own
hearths and homes.  It was not unlike the idea which
had inspired the earliest Roman legions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Republican victories
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Allies had lost their opportunity.  They did
not drive their stroke home.  France, with much
reinforced armies, took the offensive again.  She
poured into the Netherlands and into Holland.  It was
indeed only due to the inexperience of her own
commanders, and to the interference of her Government
with the generals, that the defeats of the Allies were
no heavier than they were.  A conclusion, for the
time being, of the fighting on that front was reached
in 1795, when the Austrians retired from the
Netherlands&mdash;which were then annexed to the French
Republic&mdash;when Prussia made a separate peace with
her, when the English armies were withdrawn, and
when Holland was allowed to retain her nominal
independence with the style of the Batavian Republic.
</p>

<p>
And so, ingloriously for the Allies, ended the first
coalition against Revolutionary France.  The young
Republic was for the moment saved; yet it must
have been hard to think that the salvation could be
more than temporary, so many and so strong were her
foes.  Her crisis brought forth, for her rescue, the
extraordinary being whom most historians agree in
deeming the greatest military genius in the whole
course of man's story&mdash;Napoleon Bonaparte, born, as
we have seen, in that little island of Corsica only lately
ceded to France by Genoa.  It is ever difficult to
say to what degree this or that remarkable man has
influenced the story of mankind, but we can hardly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
have a doubt of the immense effect due to the genius
of Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
He came into notice first in course of the attack
by the Republican troops on Toulon, which was held
by Royalists aided by some English and Spanish
ships.  He was a Colonel of Artillery then, and
conducted certain artillery operations with a masterly
success.
</p>

<p>
After the death of Robespierre the chief power in
the Government was put into the hands of a Council
of five Directors.  Together, they were called the
Directory.  It was their special business to see that
the laws were carried out.  The Paris mob did not
appreciate the carrying out of the laws, and rose in
protest, with the militia, called the National Guard,
supporting them.  They marched on the Tuileries,
where the Government offices were established.  The
President, warned in time, summoned that young
officer of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte, who was
then in Paris, with his batteries, for their defence.
Napoleon placed his guns to command the streets
approaching the Tuileries, and when the columns of
the mob appeared he opened fire on them with grapeshot.
Grapeshot: consider the effect of it on those
dense columns of humanity advancing through a street!
Even the Paris mob, frantic with enthusiasm, could
not stand such butchery.  They wavered, halted,
then streamed back, mangled and beaten.  The
Directory, the Government of the country, was saved.
The reputation of that artillery officer, first heard of at
Toulon, was made.  He was appointed to the command
of what was known as the Army of the Interior.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
France and the kings
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was in 1795 that Prussia had made peace, that
Austria had yielded the Netherlands, and that all
immediate danger to France from the north had passed.
And it was in the same year that the "whiff of
grapeshot" ploughed its furrows through these living masses,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
and may be said to have ended the French Revolution,
properly so-called.  From that time forward the story
is not of revolution in the heart of France but of
France struggling with, and strangling, the kings of
Europe.  And the struggle and the strangling are all
dominated by one man and his amazing personality&mdash;Napoleon.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
THE NAPOLEONIC WARS
</h3>

<p>
We have seen the Austrians fighting and suffering
defeat from France in the Netherlands.  There was
another battle ground where these two had now to
meet, and that was in the beautiful country of Northern
Italy where the Austrian Habsburgs and the Bourbons
of France and Spain had met many a time.  Of all
the Allies, Austria had the right to feel most bitterly
towards the French, for the queen whom the French
had beheaded was daughter of the Austrian Empress.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Napoleon I
</span>
</p>

<p>
As early as 1792 the armies of revolutionary France
had swept over Savoy&mdash;at that time an independent
State with which Sardinia was conjoined.  Sardinians
were now in the coalition against France, and there was
a Sardinian army co-operating with the Austrians in
North Italy.  In 1796 Napoleon was put in command
of the Army of Italy, and at once he gave evidence of
those qualities which made him the master mind in
war.

<br>
THE GREAT NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. <br>
(From an Engraving after a Portrait by Paul Delarothe.)
</p>

<p>
It is impossible here even to touch on his campaigns
in any detail; nor is it possible to select any one
campaign or a single battle as a type of his generalship
or his tactics, because perhaps the chief reason of all
his success is that he was so very able to vary them
according to the needs of each case.  It was this, that
there was no reckoning what he was likely to do, that
confused his enemies so greatly.
</p>

<p>
But in all his campaigns we find a common point,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
that he realised probably more fully than any of his
opponents the value of time, and had so masterly a
power of organisation that he nearly always arrived
at the place where he had determined to give battle
before his enemies were ready for him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was just so with this his first campaign in Italy.
He was across the Alps, with his army, and into Milan
and the Austrian dominions far quicker than he had
been expected; and here he did execute one of his
most favourite manœuvres, which, at all events,
might always be foreseen if the opportunity for it were
given him.  He thrust his army in between the armies
of the Austrians eastward and the Sardinians westward
and so disabled the latter, and less powerful, foe from
any valuable co-operation at the very outset.  Then,
turning eastward, he defeated the Austrians again and
again, driving them from Italy and pursuing them far
along the road to Vienna.
</p>

<p>
He turned southward thence and seized the lands
of Venice.  In the treaty which ended this campaign,
in 1797, France gained the Netherlands, the Ionian
Islands, and territory along the Rhine and in Albania.
The following year the French were in Rome, which
they captured, making the Pope a prisoner and
establishing what was called the Tiberine Republic.
</p>

<p>
We have to note that in all these early battles of
the French Republic, the victors&mdash;for they were nearly
always victorious&mdash;came with the pretence, at all events,
that their purpose was to relieve the populace from their
burdens, their dukes and archdukes and kings.  Accordingly
they set up this Tiberine Republic along the
Tiber, and the Transpadane Republic, of the country
beyond the river Po, and the Cis-Alpine Republic on
this side of the Alps, and so on.  We have already seen
how they had set up the Batavian Republic in Holland.
By these fine promises and pretences they gained
much favour with the civil population in all countries.
In 1798 Napoleon was no longer in Italy: he was in
Egypt, intent on extending the French power over the
East&mdash;thus quickly had events moved since France,
only three or four years before, had been fighting for
her very existence among the nations of Europe!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was English sea-power that foiled him in that
Eastern enterprise, and in the following years he was
back again&mdash;badly needed.  For there was war again
with the Austrians, who had recuperated their forces
in North Italy, and the fortunes of the war were
going all against the French.  They had been forced
to retire from Italy and from a part of Switzerland
which they had held.  French armies, moreover, had
suffered defeat on the Rhine, and in consequence the
Directory had fallen from popular favour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The First Consul
</span>
</p>

<p>
Rather as our Cromwell had once appeared, backed
by his Ironsides, in Parliament, so now Napoleon made
a dramatic entry into the Council Hall of the French
Government.  There was a cry from some of the
legislators of "No Dictator," which Napoleon's
friends, doubtless according to plan, chose to interpret
as an attack on Napoleon's person.  His soldiers
entered, and turned the Assembly out of the Hall.
The Assembly was dissolved, and a new constitution
formed which entrusted the Government for ten years
to three consuls, of whom Napoleon was nominated as
the First Consul.  The other two might be relied on
to do his dictates.  Thus, by the end of 1799 he was
the virtual ruler of France.
</p>

<p>
By his diplomacy he came to terms with Russia,
but Austrian armies still held North Italy.  Taking
the command again of the Army of Italy, he repeated
the chief incidents of the former campaign.  Again
he crossed the Alps unexpectedly; again he beat the
Austrians in Lombardy; the terms of the treaty which
had ended the former battles were reaffirmed in 1801,
and before the end of 1800 French victories on the
Rhine had re-established the position there.  Again
there was a breathing space.
</p>

<p>
Beyond question we have to look on Napoleon as
one of the most extraordinary of all the actors in our
story.  His intellectual powers, whether for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
organization of war or of peace, must have been almost
more than human: his absence of any love for his
fellows and of any kindness of heart must appear
almost equally below the human mark.  He had no
regard for truth or for morality or religion in any form.
Christian worship, abolished in France by the earlier
revolutionary Governments, had been re-established.
Napoleon was as ready to profess himself a good
Catholic in France, as to pretend a leaning towards
Mahommedanism in the East, in order to gain favour
with the Orientals.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his lack of sympathy with mankind, he
was a subtle judge of human nature.  He observed
men's weaknesses with a coldly critical eye.  He knew
that men&mdash;and Frenchmen more than most men,
and perhaps women even more than men&mdash;are attracted
and fascinated by show and splendour.  Therefore,
as First Consul, he caused all the ceremonies in
connection with Government to be splendid; he encouraged
or commanded his officers and civil servants to be
richly dressed, and their wives and daughters to wear
gorgeous gowns.
</p>

<p>
So, in this breathing space, all was triumph and
splendour in Paris; but Napoleon had already, as
we have seen, been thwarted in his great designs upon
the East by the naval defeat which he suffered from
the English in Egypt.  He realised very clearly that
England was the foe whom it was most essential that
he should remove out of his way if he were to achieve
all his ambitions for world power.  As a first step he
renewed that Armed Neutrality against her which had
been formed by the Northern Powers when she was at
war with the United States, and insisted on searching
neutral vessels to see whether they were carrying what
is called "contraband of war."
</p>

<p>
He forced Denmark, contrary to her will, into the
compact.  Against the unfortunate Denmark, then,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
England declared war, in order to drive her to
withdraw from the compact into which she had been forced
so unwillingly; and compelled that withdrawal by
a bombardment, under Nelson, of Copenhagen.  It
was here that Nelson, who was then only second in
command, is recorded to have put up his telescope to
his blind eye in order not to see the signal to break
off the engagement which had been hoisted by the
superior admiral.
</p>

<p>
Another special effort against England had been
made by the French in 1797, who landed a force in
Ireland; but it was not supported as had been expected
by the native Irish and was broken to pieces the year
following by the English troops.  Ireland was then
no part of the United Kingdom; but in 1801 was passed
the Act of Union, whereby the two did become
incorporated.
</p>

<p>
By 1803 there was again a state of active war
between Great Britain and France, and Napoleon was
threatening an invasion.  He now had the navy of
Spain to aid his own; but against him was a coalition
of Russia, Austria, and Sweden.  From the idea of
invading England, he was called eastward and southward
by the pressure of Austria and Russia, and there
the French gained a great victory over the Austrians
in the autumn of 1805.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Trafalgar
</span>
</p>

<p>
Four days later the united fleets of France and
Spain met the British at Trafalgar, where Nelson
destroyed them as a fighting force, but at the grievous
cost to Britain of his own life.
</p>

<p>
Six weeks later again Napoleon fought the crowning
land battle of that campaign at Austerlitz, when the
Russian and Austrian armies suffered a crushing defeat
which, for a time, ended the fighting and gave Europe
another short spell of peace.
</p>

<p>
A principal result of this victory was the dissolution
of that so-called Holy Roman Empire which had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
existed since the days of Charlemagne.  The title of
German Emperor was no longer known.  The electors
were abolished.  Kings were appointed by Napoleon
to govern Wurtemberg and Bavaria, Hanover was
given to Prussia, and other German States were formed
into the Confederation of the Rhine.  The ruler of
Austria retained the title of Emperor of that country.
Eighteen months earlier in the story a new emperor
altogether had been created&mdash;Napoleon himself, as
Emperor of the French.
</p>

H.M.S. &quot;VICTORY&quot; AFTER TRAFALGAR.
</p>

<p>
The cession of Hanover to Prussia cost France
nothing, for Hanover was a kingdom under the
Hanoverian King of England, to whom it was restored
at the end of the wars.  It was separated, as we have
noticed already, from England when Queen Victoria
came to the throne, because the Hanoverian succession
was governed by the Salic Law which allows no female
to succeed or to transmit the succession.
</p>

<p>
By this period in his career Napoleon was no
longer posing as a republican come to free peoples from
their kings.  On the contrary, he became himself a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
king-maker on the most extensive scale.  Naples and
Holland each had a brother of Napoleon's imposed on
it as ruler.  A little later it was the turn of Spain.
One of his Marshals was named as successor to the
throne of Sweden.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The "Continental System"
</span>
</p>

<p>
And now Prussia engaged his attentions.  She
had been a doubtful friend of both sides, for she had
received Hanover from the hand of the victor and yet
she professed to be the friend of England.  In a single
day Napoleon utterly smashed the elaborate Prussian
fighting machine; and it was actually from Berlin
that he proclaimed that state of blockade against
England sometimes called the Continental system&mdash;as
we should now say "boycotting England"&mdash;declaring
her as an outlaw, outside the protection of the law
of nations, and commanding that no Continental
port should receive her ships.
</p>

<p>
This was in 1806.  In 1807 came Russia's turn to
receive chastisement.  We may observe, however, that
neither of the Eastern Empires, Russia or Austria,
seems to have been disabled from further fighting by
defeat.  They had vast territories to retreat to and
recuperate.
</p>

<p>
So far then has gone the tide of Napoleon's success,
ever mounting.  But now, in 1808, we begin to see
it turn towards the ebb, and again it is England,
though on land this time, that is chief in so turning
it, for now begins the story of what we call the
Peninsular War, waged in Spain and Portugal.
</p>

<p>
At first it is a story of England, of Wellington,
on the defensive.  Napoleon in person is in command
of the French.  He is once more called away eastward,
to deal with Austria, and again he deals with her
drastically.  Once more he crushes her armies and
extorts from her a peace which gives a large slice of her
territories to France.
</p>

<p>
And something more it now pleased him to take
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
from Austria, a daughter of the great house of Habsburg
as his wife&mdash;for he had obtained a divorce from his
first wife.  The daughter of the oldest, proudest
family in the whole Western world was thus married
to the Corsican adventurer, become Emperor of the
French!
</p>

<p>
It appeared indeed as if there was nothing in
Europe which he might not take, if he so pleased.  He
treated spiritual power when it was opposed to him
precisely as he dealt with kings, for the Pope's reply
to his annexation of the papal dominions in Italy was
to excommunicate him; and that excommunication
Napoleon countered by sending soldiers to climb
the walls of the Vatican, the Pope's palace in Rome,
and bring out the Pope a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Still Wellington stood firmly against his troops on a
line near the boundary between Spain and Portugal,
holding back the tide.  Russia, despite Napoleon,
had opened her ports to British ships, wherefore once
more he declared war upon her.  And now, marching
into the heart of Russia in the autumn days, which
constantly grew shorter, of 1812, he came to Moscow
to find it in flames and its inhabitants gone.  Destroy
the enemy's army in the field had always been
Napoleon's maxim, but now he found no enemy to
destroy.  That enemy had all the East on which he
might fall back.  To pursue farther would be madness.
Through the snows of winter, with the Cossacks
hanging on their flanks and rear and taking every
opportunity to attack, began that return of the French
Grand Army from Russia which is one of the most
pathetic scenes in all the story.

</p>

<hr>

<p>
That tragedy was his ruin.  The powers of Europe
gathered about him again in the spring of 1813.  He
fought brilliantly on the defensive beyond the Rhine,
but against increasing odds, and in the autumn of that
year suffered the defeat that finally broke him, at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
Leipsic.  Already, earlier in the year, Wellington
had taken the offensive triumphantly in the Peninsula,
had pushed the French back, had driven and pursued
them across the Pyrenees and was on their heels in
the South of France.
</p>

<p>
For two months longer, after the blow at Leipsic,
Napoleon fought on, till he made a fatal error in turning
upon the rear of the allies to cut off their communications.
Their effective reply was to disregard that
threat, and to march straight upon the defenceless
Paris which they occupied on the last day of March,
1814.  He was formally deposed by a vote of his own
Senate, and on April 4th he abdicated.
</p>

<p>
He was taken by a British ship to Elba and
imprisoned there.  The Bourbon monarch was brought
back to the throne of France.  A congress of the
Powers sat at Vienna to restore and regulate the affairs
of Europe.  Then in February of 1815 came the
appalling news that Napoleon had escaped, was back
in the South of France, the old soldiers, fascinated by
his name and his victories, flocking to him&mdash;so he
marched to Paris with an army that ever grew as he
went.  Louis XVIII. fled.  The Emperor was on his
throne again.
</p>

<p>
Once more the Powers gathered; but for Napoleon
the only two that mattered were the British and the
Prussians, close upon the French boundary, in Belgium.
As ever of old, he sought to break these up before others
should come to strengthen them.  The Prussians had
to meet the French armies first, and had to admit
defeat, had to retreat.  Napoleon marched on to
meet the British at Waterloo; and all through the
long June day his soldiers charged again and again,
only to break upon the steadfast red line.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening the Prussians, far less shattered
by their defeat of two days before than Napoleon had
supposed, appeared upon the French right flank.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
That apparition was the beginning of the end.
Wellington ordered an advance of his whole army.
The French defeat became a rout.  The Emperor
preceded the remnants of his broken force to Paris,
where, yet again, he signed his abdication.  He had an
idea of escaping to America, but the British ships were
on the look-out, and, foiled in this, he voluntarily
gave himself up to one of them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Code Napoleon
</span>
</p>

<p>
His final destiny was the Island of St. Helena,
where he lived in failing health till his death six years
later.  One good work at least he did, in directing his
lawyers to draw up into a code, called the Code
Napoleon, the laws of France, which also were the
laws which he imposed on a large part of conquered
Europe.  Based on the existing system of laws, it
embodied many wise and liberal changes and is widely
accepted even to-day.  He was twenty-six years of
age when he won his first victories in Italy in 1796.
He had become virtual ruler of France by 1799, was
acclaimed Emperor in 1804, and set kings, chiefly
of his own family, on the thrones of Europe from 1806
onward, was prisoner in Elba in 1814, and finally
in St. Helena in 1815&mdash;surely the most amazing chapter
in the whole of this Greatest Story!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br>
THE EXPANSION OF THE ANGLO-SAXON AND THE SLAV
</h3>

<p>
In such manner this tragedy, called the French
Revolution, was played to its dénouement at Waterloo
on the European stage, and on its conclusion, despite all
the agony, we find that stage strangely little altered.
Norway had been separated from Denmark and
joined to Sweden.  Belgium was no longer Austrian,
and Belgium and Holland were united as the kingdom
of the Netherlands.  Austria had become independent
of the rest of Germany and was dominant in Italy, but
all main boundaries of the greater nations' territories
were restored nearly as they were before.
</p>

<p>
A great change, however, had been wrought in the
minds of men, by the French Revolution in the first
place and by the Napoleonic wars in the second.
Kings had been so thrown from their pedestals and set
up again that they could never more have the sanctity
in the eye of the people which they had long enjoyed.
The exaggerated reverence paid to social rank, surviving
from the exaggerated regard paid to the knight by
popular opinion in the Middle Ages, had gone.  The no
less exaggerated ideas on the subject of liberty with
which the Revolution had opened had been modified
by the inevitable discovery that it is impossible for
men to live together in anarchy and without discipline.
Indeed there was a marked reaction in thought for a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
few years after the Revolution, because men had
realised the excesses to which these liberal ideas could
lead.  But still all that was best in those ideas was
retained.  The principle was conceded that no class
should be treated as slaves by the class above.  Even
the humblest was recognised to have his rights as
man.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps that is the most important lesson which
had to be learnt by all men, kings, nobles, and poor
men alike, from those cruel years in Europe; and
it was more important than changes in territorial
possessions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Anglo-Saxon world-power
</span>
</p>

<p>
But if political boundaries were little altered in
Europe by the fighting of the Napoleonic wars, a very
extensive change will be seen to have occurred during
those years if we take the whole world-stage into our
view.  The Anglo-Saxon had been extending his
possessions and his domination almost immeasurably.
</p>

<p>
Since Great Britain was the strongest sea-power,
and at war, at one time or other of the Napoleonic
period, with France, Spain, and Holland&mdash;that is to
say, with all the colonising nations, except Portugal&mdash;it
was only to be expected that she should have
captured nearly all the colonial possessions of each.
And this actually is what had occurred.  Moreover,
on her own account she had established new settlements
in places which seemed favourable for trade.
</p>

<p>
The boundaries of Canada and most of what now is
British in the North of America had been settled by
the wars with the French in that region, and by the
War of American Independence, before the French
Revolution and all that followed it.  One of its
consequences was indeed a renewed and lamentable
outbreak of war, in 1812, between the now independent
States and the mother country.  The integrity of
Canada was threatened by it at one moment, but in
the end the boundaries were left as before.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
New Zealand, as we have seen, had been declared
a British possession in 1787.  British colonists had
established themselves in New South Wales in the
year following.  Honduras had become British some
years earlier.  And Britain had her African West
Coast Settlement at Sierra Leone.
</p>

<p>
Then in 1795 Ceylon was ceded to her by the Dutch,
and from that time onward until the end of the wars
almost every year added to her colonies.  Already
she had many of the West Indian islands.  Now she
acquired Trinidad, a little later St. Lucia, and in the
same year Tasmania and British Guiana.  In 1800
she gained Malta.  In 1806 the Cape of Good Hope
and the Seychelles, which had been held by the Dutch,
were given up to her.  A year later she took the island
of Heligoland.  Mauritius passed to her by capitulation
in 1810; and at the conclusion of the war she was
confirmed by the King of the Netherlands in her
unquestioned domination in South Africa.  All the
while, moreover, she was consolidating and extending
her hold on India.
</p>

<p>
Many of these settlements and acquisitions were no
more than the formation of so many nuclei or
starting centres whence the Anglo-Saxon was swiftly to
extend his power over vast regions&mdash;in Australia most
notably.
</p>

<p>
But despite all this nearly world-wide expansion
of what we have now to begin to call the old Anglo-Saxon
stock, an addition which was to prove of scarcely,
if at all, less importance in the story was made to the
territories of the younger branch of that stock when the
United States, in 1803, purchased Louisiana.
</p>

<p>
It was of immense importance, not only because
of the territory's own very considerable extent and
richness, but also because it so lay, as we have seen
already, as to prevent the expansion westward of the
people of British race who were settled in America
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
along the shores of the Atlantic.  For the Louisiana
of the French was vastly more extensive than the
State which now has that name.  It reached up right
from New Orleans and the mouth of the Mississippi
to the neighbourhood of the Great Lakes, so that the
United States were absolutely cut off from the west
by this French barrier westward, and by the British
Canadians northward.  It was a happy circumstance
for the world that this purchase was peacefully made
and that Anglo-Saxons&mdash;continually strengthened, we
should note, by successive immigrations of Celts from
Ireland&mdash;were thus left free to fight their way to the
west against the tribes of the Red Indians, and to
cultivate the wild.
</p>

<p>
Those unfortunate Red Indians are to be pitied
for the fate which came upon them.  Again and again
they combined and took savage vengeance on the
pioneers of the white men who were evicting them from
their age-long homes.  But they had no equal chance,
and step by step were driven back or tamed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Gradual expansion westward
</span>
</p>

<p>
Limitless therefore, until the Pacific, was now the
gradual expansion of the Anglo-Saxon westward, and
world-wide, as we have just seen, the expansion from
his ancient stock in other quarters.
</p>

<p>
But there was also another race that, all through
these years of storm in Europe, was spreading itself
extensively&mdash;though more from its own centre
outwards, and in a less scattered manner&mdash;the Slav or
Slavonic race.  All round its already great
circumference the Russian Empire was growing.  On its
immense Eastern borders were vast areas still inhabited
by nomad tribes, mainly remnants of those great
Tartar hordes which had been wont to sweep over all
that now was Russia.  Modern Russia stretched her
conquering arm ever farther and farther over them
till she came up against the borders of China and, in
the far north-east, to the Pacific Ocean.  Across the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
Straits of Behring she joined hands in Alaska with
the Anglo-Saxon when he pushed up into the extreme
north-west of his new Continent: for until the
United States acquired Alaska, by purchase, in 1867,
it was a Russian possession.  In the North of Europe
Russia had won Finland from Sweden after the fighting
of 1808 and 1809.  In the extreme south she had been
victoriously at war with Persia, and a result of that
war was that the Persian province of Georgia became
Russian.  Also she was nearly continuously, and on the
whole victoriously again, fighting with the Turk, of
which fighting the general outcome was that she gained
more and more territory in the Balkan region and more
and more authority in those Balkan States which
remained nominally independent.
</p>

<p>
And let me say now a word which will have to
apply to all the rest of the story, so far as it touches these
Balkan States, Danubian Principalities, and so on:
that the changes which have taken place in their
governments and political conditions have been so
many and so quickly varied that it is quite impossible
to give them place in this story.  They are changes,
moreover, of relatively little importance for the story
as a whole.  The population is almost inextricably
mixed, with the Slav generally predominating.  Among
this mixture the Turk appears quite alien in blood,
as he is in religion, and therefore it seems only natural
and right, that Russia, as the leading Slav nation, with
the headquarters of the Greek Church, which is the
national Church of the Slav, at her southern capital
city of Moscow, should extend, as she did, her sway
over the Balkans and that the domination of the
Turk should continually recede.  Perhaps the really
most interesting outcome of all this anti-Turk fighting
is the independence won by Greece and acknowledged
by Turkey in 1820, after some ten years of intermittent
wars.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The power of Russia
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the main we have to realise that by this date
Russia had taken over what used to be Austria's part
in the defence of Christendom against the Moslem
Turk.  Not indeed that Austria had lost importance,
except, maybe, in comparison with Russia, for she
had become for the moment the most important of the
Teutonic States.  Prussia was still her chief rival
among them, but until the other German States were
brought to act together under Prussia's lead Austria
was singly the most powerful of them all.
</p>

<p>
In a second Persian war, Russia gained a large
territory in the Caucasian district which reached
right down to the borders of Armenia.  The unfortunate
Poland, already thrice divided, had become nominally
a kingdom, but was subject to Russia's dictation,
and in 1831 she was annexed by that vast and
ever-increasing empire&mdash;-a domination from which she has
only recently been delivered as a result of the Great
War.
</p>

<p>
Thus it is that, on all sides except the west, where
she was up against the solid Teuton block of the German
States, the great Slav monster, whose appropriate
emblem was the bear, was stretching its huge grasping
paws ever farther.
</p>

<p>
The Turk had suffered losses not only from Russia,
and not only in Europe, but also in that land of Egypt
where he had been sovereign.  Napoleon had given
the Turkish armies a bad battering there before the
end of the eighteenth century.  Now, in 1811, the
Turkish power received a blow much more lastingly
severe in a revolt of the Egyptians themselves.  They
revolted against the rule of the Mamelukes, originally
a bodyguard of Turkish slaves formed to protect the
sovereign of Egypt.  The Mamelukes had continued
to be influential in the government all through the
Turkish regime.  But the popular rising against them
now was completely successful; they were massacred
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
without mercy, and Egypt passed into the hands of
a ruler entirely independent of Turkish dominance.
Under that rule she so prospered that within less than
half a century she went pushing up northward, just
as the old Pharaohs had thrust up thousands of years
before, into Syria, and won that province also back
from Turkey.

CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
STEAM AND EVOLUTION
</h3>

<p>
The realisation of the power of steam, and its
application to machinery, have made a greater difference in
this Greatest Story than any other single event that
ever happened in it before or since.  It is a realisation
that came just before the end of the eighteenth century,
and it made a greater difference between the story of
the nineteenth century and that of all the centuries
before it than there ever had been between any two
former periods.  That is indeed a large claim to make
for it, but it is none too large.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto, the force that man had made use of to
do his work had been, with few exceptions, the force
of his own muscles or those of his horses or oxen.  He
had used the winds to blow his ships along.  He had
used both wind and water to turn his corn-grinding
mills.  He had used explosive gunpowder to propel
his missiles.  Earlier still, he had used the resilient
force of wood, for his bows, to shoot his arrows, and
this was perhaps his first use of the forces of Nature
which surrounded him and which he, like everything
else, without knowing it, obeyed.  But now, all at
once, he discovered the use of another exceedingly
strong force, in steam.  The real wealth of the world
consists more truly in man's power to control and turn
to his own use the forces of Nature than in anything
else.  Hitherto he had possessed scarcely any of this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
true wealth, because his force was limited by the
muscular power of himself and his domestic animals.
Now he had a servant whose power to do work for him
was almost without limit.  The steam-engine was
invented.
</p>

<p>
When we speak of a steam-engine the first idea it
brings to mind is a locomotive engine drawing a train
or driving a ship; but it was not to this that the
steam-engine was turned on its first invention, nor is it perhaps
its most important use.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The first steam-engine
</span>
</p>

<p>
Its first use was as a stationary engine, and the
purposes to which those stationary engines could be,
and soon were, turned are far too many to tell.
Already some previous inventions in hand-worked
and foot-worked machines had greatly increased the
manufacture of textile goods in England.
</p>

<p>
But now cotton and wool began to be made into
thread by the steam-driven machines.  By them,
the thread was woven into sheets and pieces.  They
cut and finished metal and wood into the shapes needed
for a thousand different articles of daily use&mdash;furniture,
agricultural implements, pots and pans, and so forth.
They made and combined and pieced together parts
of new machines for the making of yet more and more
useful things.  They had the power to hammer out
great sheets of metal, and the delicacy to make a
thread of wire or a needle.  They became more and
more efficient and fine as experience led to improvements,
but it would be true to say that even in the very
early days of their development a machine which it
took only one man to mind and keep in working order
could do as much work as had been done by twenty
men who were served only by their own hands and
muscles.  Thus, if we may regard the productive work
accomplished as the true wealth of the nation, we find
it already increased by twenty times as the result of
this engine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
</p>

<p>
But it is no use producing more unless there are
people who want that increased produce.  And that
is exactly what there were just at this moment.  In
spite of the wars, the population had been growing
in Europe, and when they ceased, in 1815, it began
to grow even faster.  Besides, there was growth of
humanity all the world over, and especially in America.
And the end of the wars allowed the produce of one
country to be freely carried across sea and exchanged
for the produce of another.  It was especially in British
ships that the produce was carried; and this carrying
trade, as it is called, was a great cause of the wealth
which Britain began to make in this century.
</p>

<p>
She needed that replenishment, because it was
very largely by the help of her money that the
allies&mdash;especially Prussia when she was in the coalition&mdash;had
been able to keep their armies in the field against
France.  The British were very heavily taxed in and
after the Napoleonic wars even as in and after what
we now call the Great War.
</p>

<p>
This Industrial Era, of which the application of
steam power was the principal cause, had been in
progress many years before the steam-engines were
used for drawing railway trains.  Perhaps 1775 may
be given as the date of the first practical steam-engine
in Great Britain; yet it was not till 1830 that the
first steam-worked railway line was opened to the
public.  But once this new mode of travel was introduced
it quickly superseded the old mail-coach traffic
and gradually drove the coaches off the road.
</p>

<p>
Besides her carrying trade across the seas, Britain
had the good fortune to find iron ore close to her coal
in her North Midlands.  Wherever those two were
found together&mdash;the coal to heat the water into steam
for the driving of the machines, and the iron as the chief
material of the machines themselves and of a thousand
things made by them&mdash;the conditions favoured
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
manufacturing.  So, in such places, both in England and
elsewhere, there grew up the large and ever-increasing
towns, as the people gathered to work together in the
factories.  For though the machines might do the
work of twenty men, many more than twenty times
the former total of work was performed within the
space that each of these big towns occupied.

<hr>

<p>
But all this work done in the towns by the machines
meant that less work was done in the villages, and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
country cottages.  There was no longer any profitable
sale for the cloth woven at home by the little machines
which the women used to work with hand and foot,
because the very same, or almost the same, could be
made so much more cheaply by the big steam-driven
machines.
</p>

<p>
And while a machine attended by one man did the
work formerly done by twenty, what about the other
nineteen?  Obviously, at first, they fell out of work.
Therefore, when the steam-engines first came in they
produced great hardship, great unemployment.  The
men rose up against them in organised gangs of
machine-breakers.  Very many machines were broken up.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Conditions of industry
</span>
</p>

<p>
But everywhere authority prevailed in the long
run: the machine-breakers were put down.  Men
had to learn, sometimes at the cost of much suffering,
to adapt themselves to a changed condition which had
come to stay.  The point of principal importance
in the change is that it enabled the earth to support
a larger population than had been possible before.
We may notice this as a main result of each of the
successive big changes.  In the first known phase of
human society we find man in the hunting stage;
that passes into the pastoral stage, of keeping domestic
animals, which supported more human beings than the
hunting stage could.  After the pastoral came the
agricultural, with again an increase in the numbers
that the earth could support, and lastly has come this
industrial stage in which many more can be fed and
clothed and kept in tolerable comfort than ever before.
</p>

<p>
And yet this industrial era had to bring its own
hardships, and, unhappily, its own hatreds.  The
class hatred, as it is called&mdash;the animosity felt by the
man who works with his hands against the class that
has the money and works with its brains&mdash;arose directly
out of the conditions which the steam-engine produced.
To-day, when that industrial era has lasted more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
than a hundred years, it is that hatred which makes
our life so very difficult for us all, both for the classes
above and for the classes below.  And we are compelled
to realise that the hate is largely due to the hard
treatment of the lower classes by the higher in those
early years.  It is quite different now; there is little
or no animosity, as I believe, felt by the upper classes
in any country towards the lower, but I do believe that
the lower classes are in some part justified in thinking
that their better treatment has been won by their own
effort rather than freely given by those above them.
In the East the same animosities have not been aroused,
for the Eastern industries have not developed along
the same lines and have not caused the same difficulties.
</p>

<p>
In the industrial West, and everywhere that the
white man has made his settlements, the hand workers
are now protected by their organisation into Trades
Unions&mdash;combinations of workers formed principally
in order to bargain with the employers about the
wages and the hours of work and the conditions under
which the work is to be done.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the industrial era the workers
were not able to come together in this way; so the
employer made his bargain with each man separately,
and, as many were anxious to get work, the employer
could engage them very cheaply and make them work
very hard.  Nor was it only the men, or only the fully
grown women, that were thus made to labour long
hours for low pay.  Even little children, because their
labour could be engaged so cheaply, were hired to
work many hours a day at such jobs about the machines
and factories as a child could do.  Very often the
conditions as to ventilation, and so on, under which
the work had to be done, were such as would not be
allowed by the law now; but no one then seems to
have considered the hardships of the men and women
and, above all, of the children.  We may believe it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
was out of thoughtlessness and lack of recognition of
their sufferings, rather than sheer cruelty, on the
employer's part, that all this was done; but done it
was, and it has left a bitterness of feeling which still
lasts.
</p>

<p>
So the wealth of the world, as measured by its
productive labour and its power of supporting human
life, increased vastly; and its population increased
vastly therewith.  At the same time it is very much
to be doubted whether the happiness of the people
generally increased.  But gradually, by coming
together into the combinations of which I have spoken,
and so being able to say to the employer, "You will
not get any of us to work for you unless you give us
so much money for so many hours of work"&mdash;gradually,
by this argument, and sometimes by carrying
it into actual effect by "striking," and ceasing to
work altogether, they have won better and better
terms for themselves.  Employers now recognise that
the workman should receive such a wage as the profits
of the industry in which he is engaged suffice to pay
him.  Perhaps some of our more recent labour trouble
is due to the worker's claim to be paid a larger wage
than the industry can afford, if it is to turn out its
products at a cost at which any one will buy them.
And if it cannot turn them out at such cost, it must,
and it will, stop producing them altogether; so that
thus the workman is unemployed.
</p>

<p>
Further remarkable discoveries followed.  Coal gas
was used for lighting, and was later superseded by
electricity.  Electricity was used to give motion to
machinery in place of steam.  The telegraph was
invented and the telephone.  Engines were
constructed to work by means of petrol firing within
themselves&mdash;by internal combustion, as it is
called&mdash;whence came motor-cars and flying machines.
Wireless telegraphy made its marvellous appearance.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
Radio-activity with its terrifying possibilities has
been discovered.  But no one, not even all of these
together, made a new start, with a new chapter in
the story, at all in the same sense as did the application
of the power of steam.  All these others were rather
in the nature of a development from that starting-point.
They were further successful efforts on the part of
man to "harness," as has been said&mdash;which means,
to control for his own purposes&mdash;the forces of Nature.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Evolution
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was, however, one scientific discovery of
about the middle of the nineteenth century, which is
of very remarkable interest in man's history, because
it gave quite a new direction to his thoughts about his
own origin.  It is that discovery which is summed up
in the word "Evolution," and which is associated
especially with the name of Darwin.
</p>

<p>
Its main importance consists in its revelation that,
whatever we may think about the origin of man's
soul, there can be no reasonable doubt that his bodily
form, his bones and all his organs, have descended
to him from ancestors belonging to the same common
stock as the apes or monkeys.  Up to the middle of
the nineteenth century man had regarded himself as
specially created in his present form.  He had also
supposed all other living things to have been similarly
created as they are.  From 1850 or so, onward, he
had to realise that all the many and complicated forms
of life, both of plants and animals, have developed&mdash;"evolved"
was the word adopted for the process&mdash;from
the very simplest forms, even from single tiny cells.
</p>

<p>
It required countless ages for such a process;
but the discoveries of geologists and astronomers&mdash;the
earth-diggers and the star-gazers&mdash;combined to
show that such countless ages not only might, but must,
be assigned to the process.  Our universe and our
earth are by many millions of years older than men
had thought.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the chief fact of all, about this new
discovery, is that it turned men's eyes forward, instead
of backward.  They began to look with a new hope
towards the future of the race of men.  Heretofore
there had been an idea that the "Golden Age," when
man was very good and very happy, lay somewhere
in the remote past, and that present man had very
much deteriorated.  The new discovery showed him
that he was, on the contrary, continually "evolving"
into something higher, or, at the least, that, as he now
is, he has evolved from something very much lower,
even from the very lowest tiny atom that has any sort
of life.  It was an enlivening, hope-giving discovery.
</p>

<p>
But let us not ascribe to it, as some, at its first
coming, almost certainly did, more than its due.  It
revealed to man the origin of his body; perhaps, but
of less certainty, it showed him the origin of his mind.
That it tells him anything of the origin of his spiritual
self is really only asserted by those who virtually deny
that he has any spiritual side at all in his nature.
Or so, let me say to avoid dogmatic assertion, it seems
to me that they deny it.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE RESETTLEMENT OF EUROPE
</h3>

<p>
When Napoleon had been finally chained down, under
the ward of the British Government, on the rock of
St. Helena, the Emperors of Russia and Austria and
the King of Prussia made a compact, which was called
the Holy Alliance, with the principal and excellent
object of maintaining peace.  It is not easy to estimate
how far it succeeded in that good aim, because we
cannot be sure how many wars were checked by the
existence of the alliance.  Probably we ought to give
it credit for some negative results of this kind which
do not make any show in the story.
</p>

<p>
It had one curious effect, at all events.  The Spanish
settlements in South America had taken advantage
of the distracted condition of Europe to declare their
independence of the mother country.  Spain appealed
to the Holy Alliance to help her in regaining them, and
the Alliance received the appeal favourably.  But,
before anything came of it, the United States put
forward a famous declaration, known as the Monroe
Doctrine, saying that they would not tolerate any
interference, or any further colonisation, by any
European Power, in either of the American Continents.
Even so, Spain and the Holy Alliance might possibly
have proceeded with their project had Great Britain
favoured it.  But Great Britain, on the contrary, was
found to be not at all in its favour&mdash;for one thing her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
own experience in attempting to bring American
colonists under a home Government which they disliked
had not been encouraging&mdash;so the idea of putting
pressure on the Spaniards in South America was at
once and finally abandoned.  It could not have been
undertaken with any prospect of success if two nations
so dominant at sea as Great Britain and the United
States were opposed to it.
</p>

<p>
This Holy Alliance was formed between the three
most powerful and most despotic rulers in Europe.
Its essential idea was to maintain peace and order,
but, as was evident from this very design of forcibly
helping Spain to bring back her South American sheep
into the home fold, it was peace and order according
to the ideas of these despotic rulers.  That is to say,
that its ideals were in no accord with the spirit of
freedom which had been let loose by the French
Revolution, and was still working throughout the world,
although for the moment it had lost some of its vitality
because of the alarm excited by the extreme violence
of that Revolution.
</p>

<p>
Both the allied Emperors had within their
boundaries peoples over whom they held a sovereignty
by force, and much against the will of the governed.
The Russian great bear had his paw on a prostrate,
but always protesting, Poland.  The Austrian
double-headed eagle had occasion to be on watchful guard
in two directions, both east and south-west.  The
rulers of all the States of Italy held their governments
virtually under Austrian direction, and by none,
except perhaps the Pope, whom she had been influential
in restoring to his Papal States, was she beloved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Austro-Hungarian War
</span>
</p>

<p>
But she had more cause for anxious watchfulness
on the east.  In course of the gradual relaxing of the
Turk's grip on Europe, that Oriental power had been
forced to relinquish Hungary to Austria at the end of
the nineteenth century.  The population of Hungary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
was mixed, but by far the largest blend in the mixture
was of people of Magyar race, which had affinity with
the Finns, the natives of Finland.  The language and
the chief men were Magyar.  They never blended
kindly with the Germanic Austrians, and were jealous
in maintaining their own national identity.  In 1833
they obtained the concession that the debates in their
own Parliament might be conducted in the Magyar
language.  But there was ever this constant friction,
the Austrian Crown trying to reduce the Hungarians
to more complete dependence and the Hungarians
constantly striving for more freedom.  Finally war
blazed out, from all this smouldering trouble, just
before the middle of the century, when the Austrian
Emperor abdicated in favour of Francis Joseph, his
nephew, and the Hungarians refused to recognise
the nephew as their king.
</p>

<p>
The Magyar orator and statesman, Kossuth, was
the great figure in this gallant effort of the Hungarians
for their liberty.  In the early period of the struggle
the Hungarians gained victories, and there was a
moment when it seems that, had they pushed forward,
they might have taken Vienna itself, Austria's capital
city.  But they did not so push on.  The Austrian
armies were reinforced, and then Austria called in the
help of her friend in the Holy Alliance, Russia.  That
was a combination against which the Hungarians
could not well be successful.  Their revolt was put down
with cruel severity.  For the time being they gave up
the idea of independence, though their sense of a
nationality distinct from that of their conquerors
remained as vivid as ever.
</p>

<p>
This rising, and its suppression, occurred in the years
1848 and 1849.  By the year 1866 a rift had appeared
in the Alliance so-called Holy; and Austria was
actually at war with Prussia.  The war arose out of a
work of spoliation done by the two allies two years
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
before, when they had combined to take the provinces
of Schleswig-Holstein from under the rule of Denmark.
The population of those provinces was in part
Scandinavian and in part Germanic, so that they were
divided in their political desires, some of the people
favouring union with Denmark and others wishing
to be taken into the Confederation of German States.
On their own part they were claiming their
independence of the Danish rule.  There was therefore
a certain excuse for the action of these two Holy
Allies; but now, when they had done the act of robbery,
they quarrelled over the division of the spoils.  Prussia
claimed to take both Schleswig and Holstein under
her own dominance.  Austria said that she should at
least be given one of them for her share.  The result
was the outbreak of that which has been called the
Seven Weeks' War, in which Prussia was completely
victorious.
</p>

<p>
And in this brief campaign there were Hungarian
legions fighting on the side of Prussia against Austria,
their own sovereign.  That, however, did not imply
that Austria's sovereignty was weakened, and in the
following year, that is, in 1867, Francis Joseph the
Austrian Emperor, was formally crowned King of
Hungary at Buda-Pesth, the Hungarian capital.
</p>

<p>
In this way Austria and Hungary came to stand in
a curious position towards one another.  They were
two kingdoms under the same ruler&mdash;a double kingdom.
</p>

<p>
Another outcome of that Schleswig-Holstein conflict
and of the Seven Weeks' War was that the
Confederation of the German States was reconstituted.
The old single confederation was broken up into a
North German Confederation, of which Prussia was
the head, and a South German Confederation, the river
Maine being taken as the boundary between them.
Austria stood apart politically, though geographically
belonging to the Southern group.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
</p>

<p>
In spite of her defeat then, Austria maintained her
old dominance over Hungary, but she did not succeed
in maintaining for long the far less definite dominance
which the European Powers had assigned to her, at
the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars, over the various
States of Italy.
</p>

<p>
Italy was later than any other land of Europe in
settling down into the national boundaries which
remained without any break of importance until the
Great War.  We may indeed say that the very idea
of Italy as a single nation had scarcely existed before
the year 1830 or thereabouts.  Men did not regard
Italy as a unit; but thought of Tuscany, of Venice,
of the Papal States, of the Kingdom of Naples, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Young Italy Party
</span>
</p>

<p>
But the year 1831 was epoch-making, as we say, for
Italy, because it was the year in which the great Italian
patriot Mazzini began to gain men's attention.  He
formed what was styled the "Young Italy" party, of
which the leading idea might be called, according to a
phrase now in common use, "Italy for the Italians."  He
had this good ground to work on, that the people
of Italy, speaking of the country as we know it to-day,
were for the most part of the same stock and, with
certain local differences, spoke the same language.
</p>

<p>
Mazzini then, and his "Young Italy" party, went
working and speaking to inspire the people with their
own views.  Already there was a widespread hatred
of the Austrians, which made these views acceptable.
In 1846 a Pope of liberal tendencies came to the papal
throne and accorded his subjects a measure of freedom
which gave offence and alarm to the Austrians.  They
sent an army to subvert these popular measures, and
on that there was a general rush to arms on part of
the peoples of Central and Northern Italy.
</p>

<p>
For a while all went in favour of the Italian arms,
but the Austrians brought reinforcements, the tide
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
of Italian success was stayed, was driven back; by
the middle of the century all was as before the
rising&mdash;except that a keen national spirit had been aroused
in the Italian people.
</p>

<p>
For a while it could not find expression.  But in
the year 1859 it at length found outlet by the help
of a neighbour who had not usually played the part
of Italy's friend in our story.  Already, ten years
before, the French had taken a hand in the internal
struggles of Italy.  They had captured Rome, when
its citizens had declared for a republic and had driven
out their Pope; and had restored the Pope to the
sovereignty of his Papal States.
</p>

<p>
But in the interval strange things had been happening
in France.  The Bourbon who was brought back to
the French throne at the end of the Napoleonic wars,
and his younger brother who succeeded him, ruled not
much more wisely than their fathers.  Bitter experience
had taught them nothing.  In 1830 the mob of Paris
rose against the king, forced him to flee for his life,
and elected his relative, Louis Philippe, of the younger,
the Orleans, branch, king in his stead.  He was
acceptable to the people as the son of that Philippe
who had been, entitled Philippe "Egalité," because
he took the side of the people in the early days of the
French Revolution.
</p>

<p>
Louis Philippe ruled France from 1830 to 1848,
and then his government also gave offence.  Again,
there was a rising of the people of Paris, supported
by the old soldiers of the National Guard, which the
king had unwisely disbanded.  Again the rising was
successful, and now it was no longer a king of any
kind that the vote of the people called to govern them.
They declared for a republic, and as President they
elected one of the deputies to the Assembly.  The name
of that deputy was Louis Napoleon, and he was nephew
of the great Emperor.  Twice he had made attempts
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
to seize the government by force, but each time with
so little success as to seem merely ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
From the moment of his election he began to have
difficulties with the Assembly.  Its members still
seem to have regarded their President as a man of small
account, an adventurer, trading on the reputation
of his name, who twice had made himself a laughing
stock.  Then, on a certain night in 1851, he sent
soldiers to the houses of the leaders who opposed him
in the Assembly.  The soldiers took the surprised
statesmen from their beds and threw them into prisons.
The next morning Paris awoke to find its walls
placarded with the announcement that the Assembly
was dissolved and that Paris was under martial law.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Napoleon III
</span>
</p>

<p>
The people were reconciled to the surprising stroke
by the right of universal suffrage&mdash;every man of age
to have a vote&mdash;being restored to them.  There was an
attempt at a counter-stroke; but after some hundreds
had been shot down, as by that "whiff of grapeshot"
with which this Napoleon's uncle had dispersed
the Paris mob years before, all further trouble ceased.
Yet another change in the constitution of the
government appointed Louis Napoleon ruler of France for
ten years.  Less than a year later he was proclaimed
Emperor of the French with the style of Napoleon III.;
for the title of Napoleon II. had been given to the son
of Napoleon I. who had died without ever reigning as
Emperor.
</p>

<p>
There had been many adventures in the new
Emperor's life.  In his young days he had served with
the Italian revolutionists against the Papal States,
and had thus a rather personal interest in the Young
Italy movement of Mazzini.  It is certain too, and very
natural, that he felt the influence of his name, and the
tradition of his uncle's glory.  The very fact that he
had followed that uncle to the imperial throne would
strengthen that influence.  In obedience to it he was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
impelled to lead France to further adventures, in some
small imitation of that uncle's grandiose schemes.
Moreover, his hold on the throne was none too secure:
the more distraction he could find abroad for the
restless spirit of the people, the less risk there was of
disturbances to shake him from the throne at home.
</p>

<p>
Some such blend of motives seems to have driven
him to be constantly seeking occasions to put his
armies in the field.  He found such occasion first
against Russia&mdash;against Russia, and in support of the
Turk!
</p>

<p>
It was a curious reversal of all that seems right
and natural, though already we have seen the Turk
strangely and occasionally allied with one Christian
power against another.  But generally we have found
the Turk regarded as the common foe against whom all
Christendom must combine.  The truth is that the
Turk was no longer at this time the power to be
dreaded that he had been.  He had for long been
standing on the defensive in Europe, trying, but on the
whole rather failing, to hold what he had won.
</p>

<p>
And on the other hand Russia, now the Turk's
principal foe, had become so powerful that all Europe
was afraid of her, afraid of her upsetting that "balance
of power" in Europe of which we now begin to hear
a good deal.  In particular, she was reaching down to
get Constantinople for her port; and France, and
other nations of Europe, conceived it their business to
see that she did not get it, with all the increase of power
that it would bring her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Crimean War
</span>
</p>

<p>
To that opinion Napoleon III., a man of character
and abilities which have puzzled all historians, but
certainly a man of much astuteness, had brought
opinion in Great Britain.  Great Britain was beginning,
on her own account, to fear the Russian push down
towards the northern bounds of her Indian possessions.
And so now, that is to say, most particularly in 1854,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
we see another reversal, another happening rather
different from all that the story has been wont to show
us.  For we see now those old enemies, England and
France, in friendly alliance together, partners in the
very fruitless enterprise known as the Crimean War.
It was fought with much bloodshed and misery and
cost to all three nations involved, and ended in a barren
victory for the English and French.
</p>

<p>
Possibly it did check the Russians in their movement
towards Constantinople, possibly it did something
to maintain that much desired balance of power; but
of positive result there was little or even none.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the Crimean War put a final end to the
troubles between Russia and Turkey.  Russia, as the
great Slav power, was sure to find herself opposed to
Turkey, who ruled over the Slavs in portions of the
Balkans.  There was war between them again, thirty
years later, in 1877, but yet again its result solved no
problems.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the conclusion of his Crimean
enterprise the Emperor went adventuring again&mdash;on the
adventure at which I have already hinted&mdash;and this
time, it must be admitted, with a far more evident
mark set upon the world's story as its outcome.  For
in 1859, in conjunction with the Sardinian army, we
find him helping the Italians, inspired by their new
sense of nationality, to express their hatred for the
domination of Austria.  Again following the footsteps
of his great uncle, he defeated the Austrians in two
successive battles in the North of Italy, and drove
them out of Lombardy.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, under the popular leader Garibaldi, the
southern part of the peninsula had been won for the
Italian people in 1860.  An Italian Parliament, so
called for the first time, was summoned, and the King
of Sardinia elected King of Italy, though not yet with
a kingship over the whole of what we now call Italy.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
There were, still outstanding, Venice and the Papal
States.  As the price of her help, France received the
Sardinian provinces of Savoy and Nice.
</p>

<br>

<br>
GARIBALDI.
</p>

<p>
In 1866, however, this new Italy took the side of
Prussia against Austria in their fight over
Schleswig-Holstein.  Both on land and sea the Italians were
defeated, but no doubt they kept employed some of
the Austrian force which, but for Italy's help, might
have been used against Prussia, and as the recompense
that help Italy was given Venice and the Venetian
territory at the end of the Seven Weeks' War.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
</p>

<p>
Garibaldi with his followers defeated the Papal
troops, and entered Rome in the following year, but
the French, again appearing as the Pope's friend,
stepped in, recaptured Rome for the Pope, and
forced Garibaldi and his army to surrender.  It was
largely due to Garibaldi's gallant efforts, nevertheless,
that the Papal States were shortly afterwards finally
incorporated into the kingdom of Italy, and in the
following year, that is, in 1871, Rome became the
capital of the kingdom and the seat of Government.
The temporal power of the Pope was at an end; the
national unity of Italy was virtually complete.
</p>

<p>
France, at that moment, had little enough attention
to spare for affairs other than her own.  Trouble
had arisen between Napoleon III. and the King of
Prussia, leader of that Northern Confederation of
German States which Bismarck had firmly welded
together, over the succession to the Spanish throne.
Save for that Franco-German trouble, Spain, since
her great days, has made little mark on the Greatest
Story.  As we have already seen before, so now again,
she played her own part, cut off from the main stage
behind the barrier formed by the Pyrenees.  It was
a troubled drama.  One king and then another was
tried and found wanting.  An experiment with a
republican form of government had even less success.
A solution was found in going back to a representative
of the old royal family in 1875; and his successor is on
the throne of Spain to-day.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Franco-German War
</span>
</p>

<p>
As to that Franco-German war which resulted in
1870 from the dispute over the Spanish succession,
it is still debated whether its actual outbreak was due
to the ambition and machinations of Bismarck and the
military spirit in Prussia or to the restlessness and
ambition of Napoleon.  Certain it is that he was very
ready to take offence with Prussia which had already
baulked him in a design of purchasing from Holland
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
the Duchy of Luxemburg.  That project had to be
abandoned, and Luxemburg remained a Grand Duchy
attached to the throne of Holland, until 1890, when a
queen came to the Dutch Crown and Luxemburg passed
under the Salic Law to the eldest male of the same
family.  Napoleon had expected that he would be
helped, in the fight against Prussia, by Austria and also
by the Southern Confederation of the States of
Germany.  But he had under-estimated the skill with
which Bismarck held all the Teutonic States together.
Neither of these came to his assistance when he declared
war.  And within a very short time after that declaration
it became equally certain that he had wholly
under-estimated the power and the readiness for action
of the Prussian fighting machine.
</p>

<p>
In the course of a few weeks consistently disastrous
for France, two of her principal armies laid down their
arms, and at Sedan the Emperor himself was taken
prisoner.  Paris was besieged, and yielded under
stress of famine early in 1871.  Peace was made on
the terms that France should pay a money indemnity
and should give up to Germany Alsace and Lorraine.
There was the usual anarchical interlude of the
Commune, when the mob obtained temporary possession
of Paris; and finally a republican form of government
was adopted which still endures.  Those provinces
which Germany thus took from France remained under
German rule until given back to her at the end of the
Great War.
</p>

<p>
One result of the war of 1870 to 1871 was that the
domination of Prussia over the rest of the German
States was yet more firmly established.  The Southern,
as well as the Northern, were brought into one group,
and the King of Prussia assumed the supremacy over
all with the title of German Emperor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Norway and Sweden
</span>
</p>

<p>
That severance of Alsace and Lorraine from France
was the last change of really large importance made in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
the map of Europe during the nineteenth century.
It was almost the latest made before the Great War.
In Scandinavia there was a later rearrangement,
where Norway, who had for a long while chafed under
her union with Sweden and desired freedom and
recognition as a separate nation, attained her aim in
1905.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
THE SETTLEMENT OF AMERICA
</h3>

<p>
When the United States of America had once acquired
the extensive territory known at the beginning of the
century as Louisiana there was no effective bar to their
extension westward until they came to the shore of
the Pacific.  There were hostile Indians, and deserts
difficult to traverse in the slow-going wagons, but the
westward progress of the pioneers went on with no
serious sets-back and at a pace which was very
wonderful considering the conditions.  When the railway era
came&mdash;we may date its beginning approximately at
1830&mdash;the progress was much accelerated.
</p>

<p>
The population of the States grew very fast, both
by the increase of the old settlers and by immigration,
especially from Ireland.  Ireland never had been
happy in her Union with England, and her people
were discontented and very ready to try their fortunes
under the American flag.  Just before the middle of
the century the potato, on which the Irish people
chiefly live, had failed almost entirely, and there had
been cruel famine and distress, which further
encouraged them to emigrate.
</p>

<p>
Thus America grew great.  We have seen that as
early as 1823 she had put forth that announcement
known as the Monroe Doctrine, which proclaimed that
she deemed the whole of the vast South American
Continent, as well as the whole of the North which lay
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
south of the Canadian border, to be her concern, and
hers alone.  She would allow no European nation to
interfere there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The South American states
</span>
</p>

<p>
That did not imply that she herself would seek to
upset arrangements already made.  What did happen
in that South American section was that it was divided
into a number of States, which never became united,
as did the States of the North.  Most of them, very
soon after their settlement, had become self-governing,
their mother countries in Europe being too war-weary
to make very serious efforts to retain them.  Spanish
was the language of the majority, but in the State
which had by far the largest territory of all, that of
Brazil, which had rather unexpectedly fallen to the
share of Portugal under the dispensation sanctioned
by the famous Bull of Pope Alexander, the common
language was Portuguese.  The population in all of
them varied from pure European to pure Indian, with
every possible degree of mixture between.  Side by
side, on the north-east shoulder of the Continent, were,
and are, the three Guianas, the British, French, and
Dutch.
</p>

<p>
But whereas these three still are European possessions,
over all the rest of the Continent the settlers
soon threw off all allegiance to their mother lands, as
also did Mexico, once known as New Spain, at the
southern end of the Northern Continent.
</p>

<p>
Both Mexico and Brazil started their independent
careers with governors of the style of Emperor, but in
Mexico he was very soon ousted and a republican
government instituted.  In all the Spanish States of
South America, too, the form of government was
republican; but there was an Emperor of Brazil,
of the royal family of Portugal, though quite independent
of the Portuguese Government, throughout most of
the century, until she too elected to become republican.
The Continent is for the greater part exceedingly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
rich and fertile, and supplies to Europe a great deal of
its surplus products of very many kinds.  Were it
not for the frequent revolutions and changes of
government, which make property insecure and distract the
people from productive work, all these States might be
far more prosperous even than they are.  Naturally
enough they always have had many immigrants of
the Latin race.  Italians especially have been going
out to the States of that Southern Continent in very
large numbers.  The United States have attracted
the peoples of more Northern Europe, the Germans
and Scandinavia.  Of Canada the population has been
swelled by English, Irish and, largely, by Scottish
immigration.  The French have not gone there in
great numbers, but we must always remember that
there is a considerable population, in certain parts of
Canada, that is French in race and in speech&mdash;the
descendants of the original French settlers.
</p>

<p>
Even after they had acquired Louisiana, the
people of the United States did not find themselves
with an entirely unimpeded course to the West, for
Mexico, independent since 1822, possessed all or most
of that territory which you may now see marked on
the map as Texas, New Mexico, and Upper California,
all of which passed, by conquest or by arrangement,
into the hands of the United States shortly before
the middle of the century.  The transfer of California
was immediately followed by a violent rush of Eastern
Americans to the West, where gold, in great quantities,
had just been found.
</p>

<p>
Thus, or somewhat thus, the general political
boundaries of the United States and of the other
countries of the two American Continents came to
be as they are; but there was at least one moment
when the Union of the States itself was in grievous
danger of breaking up.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The slavery question
</span>
</p>

<p>
Between the States in the North and those in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
South there were certain differences in interests and
outlook which were very likely to lead to a quarrel.
There had been some difference even in their original
settlers.  As already noticed, those who went to New
England and the Northern States generally were for
the most part of the Puritan persuasion, of a humbler
social rank, and with more rigid religious views than
those who settled in Virginia and other States of the
South.  The latter were largely of the landowning
class at home, and when they came to America formed
large estates and worked them by slave labour&mdash;negro
slaves brought from America, or the descendants
of those Africans.
</p>

<p>
When Louisiana was taken over from the French,
slavery was in use all over its then vast extent.  In
the Northern section, soon to be known as the State
of Missouri, slavery was abolished.  It was retained
in the South.
</p>

<p>
The idea of the slavery of the black races was not
repugnant to the conscience of men of that day.  It
was not until later, and only after the great English
philanthropist Wilberforce had devoted his whole life
to the cause, that slavery was abolished in the British
and French West Indies.  The condition of the slaves,
once they had arrived, was not, generally, so very bad,
but the horrors that they suffered in the passage from
Africa to America were unspeakable; the death-rate
was terribly heavy; and the slave raids in Africa itself
made the lives of the wretched negroes in their native
country miserably anxious even if they evaded capture.
</p>

<p>
But the consciences of white men were not alive
to these miseries then, even as they were not alive to
the miseries inflicted by the industrial system on many
who worked under it.  When consciences did begin
to be stirred, it was only in accordance with human
nature that expressions of disgust with the conditions
of slavery should be uttered by the people of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
Northern States, who were not owners of slaves, and
should be keenly resented by those in the South who
did own slaves and whose sugar crops and cotton and
maize were cultivated by slave labour.
</p>

<p>
Thus came division between slave States and non-slave
States, that is to say, States in which slavery was
the law of the land and States in which it was not.
Now and again a slave would escape, and the right
claimed by the master of an escaped slave to follow
him and recapture him would naturally be resented in
a State which did not recognise slavery.
</p>

<p>
So dissatisfaction arose, and so it grew, over this
slave question, between the Abolitionists, as they were
called&mdash;that is, those who favoured the abolition of
slavery generally, and of the slave trade in particular&mdash;and
the anti-Abolitionists.  Nearly all the North
was of the former, nearly all the South of the latter
persuasion.
</p>

<p>
And this divergence about slavery was but one point
of difference among several.  The question of tariff&mdash;the
duties to be paid on goods entering American
ports&mdash;was another.  There were Protectionists and
Free-traders then and there, as there are here and
now.  There were States in the South that claimed the
right to "nullify," as it was called, in respect of goods
brought to their ports, the Act of Congress which
imposed the duties.  The nullifaction claim&mdash;the claim
to "make nothing of" the Act&mdash;was disallowed;
and thence arose more bitterness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The War of Secession
</span>
</p>

<p>
So the embers of discontent went smouldering until
active war broke out between the two sections in 1861;
and it broke out over a difference, which was not
actually a difference over slaves or tariffs although it
originated in those questions.  The point on which it
broke out was this: that the Southern States claimed
for themselves the right to secede, to cut themselves
off, from the Union.  That is why the war is called
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
the War of Secession.  They even called themselves
by a distinctive name, not the "United," but the
"Confederate" States.  The North resisted, and
refused them the right to break away and govern
themselves as they wished.  It was, perhaps we may
think, a singular position to be taken by those United
States which had lately fought so well and triumphantly
to gain their own independent right to self-governance,
but almost certainly it is a good thing for mankind
that they did take that attitude.  Had the attempted
"secession" succeeded, the States of North America
might have been as disunited as the States of South
America; and so might never have stood, as they do,
a strong force for peace in the world.
</p>

<p>
The War of Secession was waged with varying
fortune, at first rather favouring the South, though
always it was the South which, as the chief battlefield,
had to endure the worst of the misery.  It was
a particularly cruel war in the divisions that it caused
between friends and even between families.  There
were moments when the cause of the North was in
great danger; but the North was able to dispose of
rather larger forces and perhaps of a tougher type of
soldiery, although the endurance and the aptitude for
strategy and fighting seem to have been remarkable
on both sides among armies of which only a small
minority were soldiers by profession and training.
The Northern advantages were compensated by the
very remarkable military ability for war of the Southern
leaders.
</p>

<p>
The sympathies of Europe and of England generally
were rather with the South than with the North, and
England gave some just cause of offence to the North
by allowing the South to fit out privateering vessels in
British ports.
</p>

<p>
It was not until after four years of fighting, that is
to say, in 1865, that the end came with the surrender
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
of General Lee's Southern army to the forces of General
Grant at Appomatox in Virginia.  That was the end
of the fighting, and peace terms were agreed very
shortly afterwards.  The claim of any State or collection
of States to break away from the Union has never
been put forward since, and the authority of Congress
was confirmed over the whole Union.
</p>

<p>
The effects of the war were grievous for the
vanquished.  Their fairest territories had been overrun
by the troops of both sides, their crops had been ruined
and, heaviest blow of all, their slaves were emancipated
so that there was the less labour available to repair the
losses.  All the money that they might have spent in
hiring labour had gone in the war, and the problems
of the peace were scarcely less difficult than those of
the war.
</p>

<p>
It was very many years before the South recovered,
and it has scarcely recovered now.  Nor has the bitter
feeling of the South towards the North, which arose
from the war and from the many differences of which
it was the outcome, even yet wholly died away.  As
lately as 1924 a member of one of the old Virginian
families told me that the Great War, of 1914-1918,
by summoning Americans from North, South, East,
and West to serve in the same regiments and in a
common cause, had done more to bring them together
and create a sense of unity, and dispel the
misunderstandings, than anything that had happened in all
the years between the American War of Secession and
the Great War.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Maximilian in Mexico
</span>
</p>

<p>
While the United States were thus in the agonies of
their Civil contest, an attempt was made to interfere
with the affairs of Mexico which was in direct defiance
of that Monroe Doctrine already mentioned.  Just as
there is now, at this time of writing, so were there then,
Europeans and European property in Mexico which
the Government of the country was not able to make
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
tolerably secure.  It did not seem to be putting out
much effort to secure them.  Europe thought then,
as she is perhaps justified in thinking now, that if the
United States forbade any foreign interference with the
American Continents it was their business to see that
the States of those Continents behaved themselves in
a reasonable manner.  At that moment the United
States were obviously unable to undertake any such
responsibility.  Europeans in Mexico therefore
appealed to Europe, and especially to Napoleon III.,
to enforce a better government on the country.  It was
the sort of appeal to which the character of Napoleon,
made him peculiarly ready to respond, and under his
promise of support Maximilian, brother of Francis
Joseph of Austria, went out to take over the
government of Mexico, with the title of Emperor.  His
reception was by no means as warm as he had expected.
On the contrary, he found his own partisans inferior in
force to those of the opposing faction.  For a brief
while he held a nominal rule over some two-thirds
of the country.  The French troops supporting him
were quite insufficient to put down the native republican
bands.  His position was very shaky even at its
best.
</p>

<p>
Then in 1865 the United States, freed from their
Civil War, reasserted the Monroe Doctrine, and made
some demonstrations under arms which clearly indicated
that they were ready to give active effect to it.
Upon that, Napoleon recalled his French troops, and
the already shaky position of the Mexican Emperor
at once became desperate.  He was captured, tried
by a court martial, condemned, and shot.
</p>

<p>
So, tragically and ingloriously, ended what really
was Europe's one and only attempt at action opposed
to the doctrine enunciated by Monroe.
</p>

<p>
A certain implication, or what has been considered
an implication, of that doctrine, namely, that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
United States shall abstain from any interference with
affairs foreign to her own two Continents, even as she
has forbidden the foreigner to interfere with them&mdash;this
implication she violated, most happily for Europe,
in the Great War.  But she had already violated it in
her own Spanish war, of 1898, which followed on
Spain's ineffective attempts to restore reasonably
good government in Cuba, that island which lies in a
position to guard the Gulf of Mexico and the Panama
Canal.  Spain was unable to enforce respect for the
lives and property of Americans in the island, and,
not unjustifiably, the United States, after some years
of long-suffering, resolved that the Spanish rule must
be overthrown.  Even America herself shared in the
general surprise that the complete defeat of Spain was
so easy; and she was genuinely surprised also to
find the sympathy of Great Britain cordially with her
in the short war.
</p>

<p>
And as its results, not only Cuba itself, but also the
far-off Philippines, those Spanish-owned islands where
Portuguese going East and Spaniards going West had
unexpectedly met a few centuries before, were given
over to the United States.
</p>

<p>
Nearly at the same time certain Samoan Islands and
the Hawaiian group of islands were annexed to the
United States.  Therefore she too must now shoulder
her portion of what Kipling has well called "the
white man's burden."

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
SECTION I.&mdash;AFRICA
</p>

<p>
I have taken the above heading for this chapter because
it indicates truly the manner in which the dominion of
the white man over many of the coloured races has
been thrust upon him.  There is a good deal of
misunderstanding on the subject.  Really the world-wide
dominion of the British Empire, to take the most
conspicuous example, has been forced upon the mother
country.  There is an idea, and some of our rival
nations have specially encouraged it, that those
overseas dominions have been won by our aggressive spirit,
land-grabbing and desirous of ever acquiring new
possessions.  Even we ourselves are rather apt to
attribute it to the adventurousness of our ancestors;
as if they had gone out seeking adventures like the
knights-errant of old.
</p>

<p>
If we regard the events as they actually did happen
we must confess the process much more prosaic.  No
doubt very adventurous and heroic deeds were done
during its course.  We have every right to be proud
of our Anglo-Saxon race on their account.  But our
principal reason for pride is to be found in what the
race has done, less in aggression, than in defence.  It
was Britain that was very largely concerned in humbling
the overweening ambition of Spain, in baulking
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
the arrogance of Louis XIV., in thwarting the projects
for world empire of Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
But what happened in the spread of the white
man's power all over the world was that he went here
and there, in the first place, and settled, for purposes of
trade.  We have seen the Portuguese going down the
west coast of Africa for slaves and gold and ivory;
Spain crossing the Atlantic for the treasures of El
Dorado, the supposed city of gold; Portuguese, Dutch,
and English going easterly to India, and farther, all to
see what they could bring back.
</p>

<p>
They settled.  Then they found that, in order to
trade peaceably, and with tolerable security, they had
to take control of the city or territory in which they
settled.
</p>

<p>
That is, in few words, the story of the whole
process.  The settlements were at first along the coasts,
and then gradually extended inland, as the boundaries
of the districts already settled were everywhere
threatened by the unsettled peoples outside the
boundaries.  We saw the process in action in the
British Empire in India.
</p>

<p>
That is the common story.  It is a little varied by
the special circumstances of such countries as Australia
and parts of South America which favoured the
raising of sheep and cattle.  There the settlers extended
their boundaries not so much for security as to gain
more pasture lands.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat thus, then, is the manner in which the
white man has been forced, if he would develop the
earth so as to afford support for its increasing
population, to take this burden on his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Africa, being so accessible to Europe, was the first
of the new countries to which Europeans went trading
in their ships.  In a very early chapter of the story
we have seen that many of the ports along the north
coast of Africa, which is the Southern Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
shore, were nests of pirates preying upon the trading
shipping.  That was a condition of affairs which
became more and more intolerable to Europe as the
trade increased.  It was with the approval of all
Europe that the French in 1830 captured and took
Algiers, which was the headquarters of the Moorish
pirates.  They extended that possession over the
whole of Algeria till they reached the Turkish
possession of Tripoli, which, again, extended to Egypt
easterly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Egypt
</span>
</p>

<p>
Egypt had freed herself from the suzerainty of
Turkey about the date, 1830, of France's annexation
of Algiers.  Under an able ruler she developed her
resources and was well governed, but from about 1870
onward, under a far less able successor, both government
and finance fell into confusion.
</p>

<p>
In 1876 the British Government acquired by purchase
the larger number of the shares in the Suez
Canal.  As a short cut to India, the Suez Canal was of
vital interest to Great Britain.  It was of vital interest,
too, that the traffic through it should be safe and well
conducted.  This led to an inquiry into the condition
of the Egyptian government, which showed that
unless these conditions were bettered it was most
unlikely that the Canal would be properly controlled
and made safe.
</p>

<p>
The outcome was that the English and French established
themselves in a joint control&mdash;it was called a
Dual Control&mdash;over Egypt, in 1879.
</p>

<p>
Three years later, again, Egypt revolted against
this control.  England asked France to join her in
forcibly putting down the revolt.  France declined.
England then invited the aid of Italy, for Italy had an
interest both in Egyptian affairs generally, and in the
Suez Canal especially, because she had established a
coaling station, where her ships might replenish their
coal supplies, in Eritrea, a district far down on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
west shore of the Red Sea.  But Italy also declined.
Therefore Great Britain went in alone to restore
order.
</p>

<p>
The revolt was effectually quelled; but Great
Britain dared not leave the country to the mercies of a
native or of a Turkish ruler.  She had to stay, in the
very interests of Egypt herself.  At the moment of
writing, Egypt has been given a large share of
self-government, of which she still has to prove herself
altogether worthy.
</p>

<p>
And this burden of Egypt, thus undertaken, led
on to the shouldering of yet another, of the country
southward, the Sudan.  Really it is a burden inseparable
from the burden of Egypt, because the Nile, which
is Egypt's very life-blood, passes through it, and
because it is, or it was, the home of wandering
slave-making Arab tribes always liable to inflict raids on
Egypt itself.
</p>

<p>
Hence arose expeditions and again expeditions, in
some of which Great Britain's arms suffered heavy
reverse, against one or other of the fanatical Arab
leaders who arose and assumed the title of Mahdi.
The loss which stands out most tragically in England's
memory is that of General Gordon, at Khartoum, in
1885.  It was not until 1898, and the decisive defeat
of the Mahdi by Lord Kitchener, that the problem of
the Sudan could be regarded as tolerably solved.  We
may note that the manner of fighting of the Arabs was
to charge in cavalry masses.  It is mode of attack
which gives a target terribly exposed to the fire of
modern machine guns; and that gun has greatly
diminished the danger of civilised troops charged by
those desert warriors.
</p>

<p>
In the south of Africa the burden of the white man
had at first lain chiefly on the shoulders of the Dutch,
and the story of South Africa in the nineteenth century
is mainly the story of the shifting of that burden to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
British.  It was in the year of the battle of Waterloo
that the Dutch possessions, from the Cape of Good
Hope northward, were ceded to Great Britain by the
King of the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Boers
</span>
</p>

<p>
But the Boers, as the colonial Dutch were called&mdash;the
name is akin to German <i>bauer</i>, a peasant&mdash;were,
and are, a people who valued their nationality and their
independence.  It was not for more than thirty years
that they formally acknowledged the British rule,
which in the meantime had been extended to include
the district of Natal.  After a few years of experience
of that rule, the Boers made a great "trek," or exodus,
and established themselves farther north, beyond the
British domination, in what was then called the
Orange Free State.
</p>

<p>
And there it is possible they might have dwelt for
many generations as a free republic of farmers had it
not been for the discovery, some twenty years later,
of the diamond mines in the Transvaal district, farther
north again, whither the Boers had by that time
extended their occupation.
</p>

<p>
The effect of that discovery was to attract to the
region of the diamond mines a rush, chiefly of British,
but of variously mixed, nationality.  Ten years later
the Transvaal was proclaimed a British possession,
and almost immediately the Boers went to war to
maintain its independence.
</p>

<p>
The war was inglorious for Great Britain and involved
a serious disaster to a considerable British force.
It ended in a compromise which did not promise much
security for the future.  The Boers acknowledged the
suzerainty of Great Britain and, subject to that not
very clearly defined control, were conceded the right
of managing affairs in the Transvaal.  That was in
1881.
</p>

<p>
And from that time until the end of the century
trouble grew and grew between the increasing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
population of the diamond fields and the increasing numbers
and strength of the Transvaal Boers.  Britain's
position was difficult.  These Boers had been the first
to shoulder the white man's burden&mdash;if we like to put
it in that way.  They had been the first to drive out
those black people who had owned the land before
them&mdash;if we prefer to put it so.  Whichever way we
prefer, they had a right prior to that of those diamond
finders, who came in and bought up their farms at
great prices and were not at all welcome to the majority
of the Boers whose farms did not happen to lie over
diamond-producing strata.
</p>

<p>
From that point of view, all the argument seems
to be on the Boers' side.  But there is another point
of view.  These diamond searchers had come in in a
perfectly peaceful way.  They brought much wealth
to the Boer Government which taxed them very
severely, and really did not give them fair and decent
treatment.  The result was the breaking out, in 1899,
of the great Boer War which went for a while so hardly
for Great Britain that it looked at one moment as if
her armies might be forced right back to the sea.  Not
only the Transvaal Boers but those of the Free State,
and of Natal, joined together.  Fortunately for Great
Britain, Cape Colony, where the British element was
largest, stood firmly for the Empire.  At length the
fortune of war turned, as more and more British troops
arrived from oversea.  By 1903 it was ended: the
Boers surrendered at discretion.
</p>

<p>
And then was done one of the noblest and most
generous and most courageous acts that the whole
of this Greatest Story is able to show in the way of the
treatment of a vanquished people by the victors: a
very large part of the independent rule for which the
vanquished foe had been fighting was voluntarily
given to him.  It was a tremendous experiment&mdash;tremendous,
in the most literal sense of the word;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
that is to say, an experiment to be feared.  It seemed
an immense risk to take&mdash;thus to rely on the sense
of gratitude of a beaten foe.  But that foe showed
himself as generous in acceptance of the experiment
as Great Britain in making it.  He proved his gratitude
by devoted service for the Empire in the Great
War.  It was a tremendous experiment, wonderfully
justified.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The division of Africa
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is not needful, for the purposes of this story,
to go over in detail the possessions, and their
boundaries, of the various white nations in Africa.
The French have a huge area in the north-west,
reaching right down from Algeria to a junction with
the Congo River.  The Belgian Congo lies between
that French area and British Rhodesia, which joins
the other British colonies farther south.  Great Britain
has Nigeria on the west coast and British East Africa
on the east.  Portugal has Angola on the one side and
Mozambique on the other, with the large island of
Madagascar, which is French, lying off it.  Abyssinia,
easterly of the Sudan and bounded on the east again
by the British and the Italian Somalilands, is by far
the greatest and most interesting of the African
countries still in the possession of a coloured race.
Even Morocco, just westerly of Algiers, is now under
French protection, and on either side of it lies a territory
that is under Spain.
</p>

<p>
These many and very different countries have not
been won for the white man without heavy fighting
with the natives whom the white intruders found there.
Great Britain has had its severe campaigns against
the Kaffirs and the Zulus in the south.  The Italians
have received very rough handling from the Abyssinians.
Spain and France still have their troubles in the north.
But the white man has prevailed, and must prevail
increasingly as his better science puts better
instruments of war into his hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
</p>

<p>
There remains one great nation not yet named in
this chapter which also had extensive possessions in
Africa until the Great War&mdash;Germany.  It was not
until rather a late date in the story that Germany,
under the strong hand of Bismarck, had been welded
into a nation at all.  The year 1884, when the German
Colonisation Society was founded, may be taken as
the date when she set to work with the deliberate
and avowed purpose of taking her place among the
colonising nations.  It was less a matter, with her,
of shouldering a burden thrust upon her, than of
going out of her way to seek the burden, in her fear
lest the other nations should possess themselves of all
the unclaimed spaces before she could stretch out a
hand for them.
</p>

<p>
Acting from this motive, she obtained, on the
west coast of Africa, the large territory of the
Cameroons&mdash;now, since the Great War, under the
French mandate&mdash;of German South-West Africa&mdash;now
under the mandate of the Union of South Africa&mdash;and
of German East Africa&mdash;now under the mandate
of Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
Of all these, the last was perhaps of chief importance
from the point of view of the Anglo-Saxon dominance,
because there was a small portion of its north-eastern
boundary where it joined with the Belgian Congo,
and it was just this, and only this, junction which
intervened between the Anglo-Saxon protectorate of
Uganda on the north and the long lake of which the
southern shore was part of Rhodesia.  That is to say,
that this junction of Germany with Belgium alone
prevented an all-British route, by river, lake, or land,
from the Mediterranean mouth of the Nile to the Cape
of Good Hope.
</p>

<p>
With the mandate to Great Britain of German
East Africa, which was one of the results of the Great
War, that intervention has been removed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
</p>

<p>
This then, in bare outline, is the way in which
the burden of Africa has been distributed on the
shoulders of the white men.

<p class="t3">
SECTION II.&mdash;INDIA AND THE FAR EAST
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
India
</span>
</p>

<p>
Already we have seen something of the way in which
the burden of India came to be borne&mdash;the British
East India Company, which was purely a trading
concern, being forced to take military measures, for
the defence of its trading stations and for the
maintenance of good order, at one time against the French
who were aiming at the establishment of an empire
and at another against the native rulers, or rather
the mis-rulers, of the Indian States.
</p>

<p>
It was thus that the Company came to have an
army in its pay and to hold the control over extensive
lands and many peoples.  It was a position never
contemplated when the Company was formed, nor was
it a position entirely welcome to its directors.
Continual additions had been made to the territories over
which its control spread.  The most notable perhaps
were the addition of Cashmere in 1846, of the Punjab
in 1849, and of Oudh in 1856.  Farther east even than
India, to the Straits Settlements and even to China
itself, the authority reached of this vastly overgrown
trading concern.  Obviously it involved a control
which could far better be undertaken directly by the
British Government than by a Company acting under
its charter.  But with that typically British tendency
to let things go on as they are going until it is impossible
so to let them go any longer, nothing was done to
transfer the Company's power to the Crown until the
crisis came in the shape of the most formidable rising
of a coloured people which the white man ever has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
been called on to meet in the whole course of taking up
his burden.  It is that known as the Indian
Mutiny&mdash;"mutiny," because it was mainly the affair of the
native soldiers in the Company's pay.  This was in
the years 1857 and 1858.  It threatened the very
existence of the white man in the East, and only
a splendid heroism in resistance to heavy odds,
and heroic efforts and forced marches to relieve a
situation nearly desperate, saved the principal, though
scanty, British force from being annihilated.  Once
more the British wonderfully won through to a final
victory, but the events of the war had brought into
clear light the long known fact that the government
of British India was an affair which demanded the most
direct attention of British statesmen, with all the
resources at their disposal.  The East India Company
were relieved of their far too heavy burdens.  The
Crown took over their responsibilities both in India
and in the farther East.
</p>

<p>
The responsibilities of India were not only those
which arose from the troubles incidental to a rule over
peoples of different race and of religions&mdash;the Moslem
and the Hindu&mdash;which brought them often into collision
with each other.  There was another trouble which
began to menace like a dark cloud on the north-eastern
boundary of the country, where lay the
independent State of Afghanistan bordering with Persia
on its east and with Russia on its north.
</p>

<p>
Russia had taken no part in that overseas colonisation
by the other great powers of Europe.  She had
vast spaces enough, contiguous to her own bounds,
over which she spread.  Gradually she had annexed
all Turkestan, which brought her into direct contact
with Afghanistan, and she had been at frequent war
with Persia over the question of the Russo-Persian
boundary on Persia's north-west.  Both Persia and
Russia had ambitions to absorb that independent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
Afghanistan which lay in the corner where they
joined, and where, but for Afghanistan, they would
join British India also.  It was Britain's policy to
maintain Afghanistan independent, as a buffer between
her and those others, especially against Russia.
</p>

<p>
But it was to Persia, in the first place, that she had
to say "hands off," when Persia advanced to the
important position of Herat, within Afghan territory,
in 1852.  The result of campaigning and fighting
lasting over some five years was that a friendly
agreement was reached with Persia, which settled boundaries
and left Herat to the Afghans.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Russia's menace to India
</span>
</p>

<p>
But in 1887 Russia, from the north, pushed down,
and was across the Afghan boundary and advancing
to that same Herat, when she was checked only by
very forcible representations made to her by Great
Britain.  Britain herself had pushed her own Indian
frontier forward by the acquisition of Beluchistan in
1878.  Russia withdrew her forces for the time being,
but all through that century and for some years of
the present, the dread that she would come down upon
India was always in the minds of British statesmen.
There was more than one moment when war seemed
imminent.  Possibly it was nothing but Russia's own
doubt of her effective fighting power which averted
it.  No suspicion of her internal weakness was
entertained in Europe generally until it was revealed by
the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and yet more clearly
by the Great War of 1914-1918.  But there is little
doubt that this small State of Afghanistan, which
arose out of the Moslem spread towards the East many
centuries before, saved Britain and Russia from
disastrous collision.  She had played the game that a
small State thus situated was likely to play, intriguing
with the great powers on either side of her and taking
advantage of their rivalry.  More than once there
has been war between her and Great Britain.  But she
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
remains an independent State and Britain's friend
to-day.
</p>

<p>
On India's north-eastern side Britain extended
her Empire by the acquisition of Assam in 1826, and
later by that of Burma in 1886.  The French had
taken to themselves Annam and Tongking in 1884,
and thus the British Burmese territory marched with
French Indo-China, as it was called, and both were
bounded on their northern side by the great Chinese
Empire which stretched right up to Siberia.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Affairs in China
</span>
</p>

<p>
For the last hundred years or so, the story of China
has been largely the story of her efforts to prevent the
foreigner from coming into China and playing any
part in her story.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless we find the white man pushing on,
in his eternal quest for trade, not to be denied, founding
trading stations at Chinese ports.  Generally it is
only in submission to a show of force, or to its active
application, that these trading facilities, warehouses
and so on, are permitted to him.  He is obliged to
fight to be allowed to establish them, and further, we
find him fighting again to punish the native people
who have disregarded the agreements they have made
with him and who sometimes have killed the peaceful
traders.
</p>

<p>
Out of the troubles thus arising came war between
Britain and China as early as 1840.  The Chinese were
quite incapable of seriously opposing the large British
force which was sent out.  The result was the
conclusion of a commercial treaty which opened five
principal ports of China to British trading vessels
and gave Britain possession of the island of Hongkong.
In 1854 Shanghai, one of the five ports above named,
was opened to the trade of all nations.
</p>

<p>
But still the attitude of the people and of the
Government was hostile to the foreigner.  At any
moment an uprising and a general massacre might
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
happen.  A few white missionaries, chiefly of British
and American nationality, penetrated into the country,
preaching Christianity at constant risk of their lives.
</p>

<p>
The year 1860 saw a great change in the relations
of the white men and the Chinese.  Hitherto any
fighting between them had been near the coast and
the great ports.  Now, as a protest against the
ill-treatment of which the foreign traders were the victims
and the bad faith with which the Chinese broke the
treaties, and also to insist on the establishment of
legations of the European Powers to protect the
interests of their nations, a strong combined force of
British and French marched on Pekin, the capital
city, and looted and burnt the sacred Summer Palace
from which the Emperor had fled.
</p>

<p>
The really important result of the campaign was
the shock which it gave the Chinese and the conviction
which it brought home to them of the strength and
determination of the white men.  Thereafter they
treated the foreign traders with a consideration never
paid them before, and ministers representing foreign
powers had their appointed residences in Pekin.
</p>

<p>
It is true that as lately as 1900 a combined foreign
force was obliged to march in extreme haste on Pekin
in order to save those ministers, who were in great
peril there.  But it was peril arising out of an
insurrection against the Government, rather than
immediately from the Government's own action.
Nevertheless it is also true that the very clever old
Empress, who was then ruler of China, deliberately
contrived to convert the activities of the revolutionaries
into an attack upon the foreigners, rather than upon
the Government itself.  And it is to be noted that in
co-operation with that combined army, which thus
again invaded China's once sacred capital, was a force
of the other branch of the yellow race, the island
branch, the Japanese.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
</p>

<p>
The story of that island branch is certainly no less
interesting than that of the continental.  At what
point far back in the story they branched off from a
common stock we do not know, but it is more than
probable that they came from the same original source.
We found Kublai Khan, when master of China and
of an immense part of the world besides, sending out
from China an expedition against the islanders, of which
the fate was much like that of the Grand Armada
which the masterful power of Spain launched against
our own islands.  Japan kept her independence then,
and has fought for it again and asserted it conclusively
far later.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The awakening of Japan
</span>
</p>

<p>
She too, in her story, seems to have repeated, as
did China, something very like the series of changes
through which society passed in Europe, with its
feudalism and the rest of it.  But whereas in modern
China this feudalism seems to belong to some era very,
very far back in her story, so that she has almost lost
all memory of it, with Japan, on the contrary, it is a
very recent chapter&mdash;later even than with us of
Europe.  It is a condition from which she has indeed
only just shaken herself free.  1867 is generally given
as the date at which Japanese feudalism passed.  And
it passed in a fashion for which there is certainly no
parallel in Western story.  The Daimios, who were
the feudal lords, of their own accord agreed, as the only
means of ending their mutual fighting, to give up their
local powers into the hands of the Mikado.
</p>

<p>
The white men knew very little about Japan until
the sixteenth century.  No overland travellers, like
Marco Polo, had been there to bring back news to the
West.  About the middle of the sixteenth century a
few Portuguese trading vessels touched it, and the
very famous Jesuit missionary Xavier introduced
Christianity.  Here, however, as elsewhere, the Jesuits
seem to have caused trouble by interfering with politics,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
and the exclusion of the foreigners was enforced more
strictly than ever.  Gradually, especially towards
the end of the eighteenth century, trade with foreigners
began to grow, chiefly with the Dutch, the Russians,
and the Americans.
</p>

<p>
But still Japan continued, like China, to hold aloof
as much as possible from all intercourse with the
West, and with its science and progress.  America
at length took the decided step of sending a strong
naval force and demanding the opening of a port to
American ships of trade.  This was in 1850, but the
real opening up of the country did not begin until
after the end of feudalism and the establishment of
the Mikado's single power in 1867.  And then a most
extraordinary change did happen&mdash;a change perhaps
more extraordinary than any other of which we find
record in the whole history of mankind.
</p>

<p>
We may describe the story of China for many
centuries as the story of a people buried in a profound
sleep.  She shows but little immediate sign of awaking
from that slumber even to-day.  The story of Japan
in the latter half of the nineteenth century we may
designate as the most astonishing awakening of a
nation out of slumber that the world has ever known.
</p>

<p>
Even now the part played by great China is only a
passive, a negative part (except, of course, so far as
her own people are concerned), but the part played by
little Japan, though perfectly passive until some
two-thirds of the nineteenth century had gone, has been
startlingly vigorous and effective.  The truth is that
beneath the slumbering surface the spirit of the people
had always been active, inquiring, ready for any novelty
that struck them as valuable&mdash;in great contrast to the
indifference of the Chinese.  Their seclusion had been
forced upon them by their rulers.  When that enforcement
ceased, they welcomed with very keen intelligence
all the progress in science and thought which steam
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
and evolution had given to the West.  In religion and
in art they seem to have been satisfied to follow their
own traditions, but they took every possible opportunity
to learn lessons that might be of practical use.
Military experts were called from Germany and naval
experts from Great Britain to teach the art of war
by land and sea.  Scientific, educational, and legal
advisers were engaged.  The nation set itself with
astonishing quickness to learn all that the West could
teach it, and within a few years the efficiency of both
army and navy were very thoroughly proved.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Korea
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the coast of China, just opposite Japan, lay the
independent State of Korea.  Its people were of the
yellow race&mdash;not great fighters, but they had successfully
resisted some rather half-hearted efforts of the
Chinese to subdue them.  Against the Chinese they
invoked Japanese help&mdash;and not in vain.  Japan had
an interest in this country which lay just opposite
her own islands, across a narrow sea, and which gave
an outlet for her own surplus population.  Over the
Korean question, then, Japan and China came to war
in 1894.  The Japanese armies met and repeatedly
defeated the Chinese, in the north of Korea and in the
Chinese province of Manchuria just northward again.
At sea, it was evident that Japan still had much to
learn, for the Chinese for a while had rather the better
of the naval engagements.  Finally the Japanese
prevailed there also.
</p>

<p>
One result of that war was that Korea was formally
declared independent, but the Government was so
feeble that the Japanese, in the years that followed,
gained more and more power over it.  By the terms
of peace, the large island of Formosa was ceded to
Japan.  But the war's most important result was to
reveal to the Western powers the weakness of China.
Russia, thwarted in her advances towards India, was
pushing but eastward into Manchuria, and now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
encouraged China to resist some of the demands of the
victorious Japanese.  In compensation, she obtained
for herself certain advantages, as the friend of China.
China handed to her Manchuria, partly as the result of
pressure, partly of friendly persuasion.  What was
of still more importance for her was that she acquired
the ice-free harbour of Port Arthur; for hitherto her
only Pacific port had been Vladivostock, farther north
and often ice-bound.
</p>

<p>
It mattered comparatively little to Japan that
Great Britain and Germany, to balance these gains
of Russia, demanded and took for themselves, from
the enfeebled hands of the Chinese, ports in the same
neighbourhood.  What did matter was that the menace
of Russian power, and Russia's insatiable desire to
expand, became more and more formidable to her.
But among the peace terms which she had not failed
to extort from China was a large money indemnity,
and that money she spent in buying ships of war.
</p>

<p>
So then, in 1904, as Russia grew more and more
aggressive in her eastward push, Japan, confident
in her German-instructed army and her British-instructed
and greatly enlarged fleet, ventured on a kind
of David and Goliath contest.  She declared war on
the vast power.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Russo-Japanese War
</span>
</p>

<p>
And, just as, through the test applied by this
surprising little island power in the Pacific, had been
revealed the essential weakness of great China, so now,
to the astonishment of the world, was revealed by the
very same test the weakness of great Russia.  The
Russian fleet, sailing from the Gulf of Finland,
circumnavigated the world to come into touch with the
Japanese fleet awaiting it in Japan's home waters;
and at the very first touch that sea-worn fleet of Russia
was sent to the bottom, save for such inconsiderable
remnants as the Japanese allowed to remain afloat or
to run ashore.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
</p>

<p>
On land the fighting was hard.  Port Arthur,
strongly fortified, held out bravely, but was invested
and forced to yield.  The Japanese armies were
victorious, driving the Russians back, but at price of
a continually lengthening line of communications as
the battle rolled north.  The victories had cost Japan
the very utmost that she could afford.  She consented
to terms of peace which surprised Europe by their
moderation.  But the details were of little importance
compared with the astonishing achievement.  This
little island State, scarcely emerged out of its feudal
era, had become, at a stroke, a great modern power,
the naval ruler of the Pacific, Great Britain's
counterpart in the East, and her ally on equal terms.
</p>

<p>
She might now gratify her wish about Korea, and
formally declared it a Japanese protectorate in 1910.
The Russian menace was rolled back, by the restoration
of Manchuria in the same year.
</p>

<p>
In the Great War Japan more than confirmed her
claim to high place among the nations.  She was
active in scouring the sea for German marauders of
commerce, and very early in the war captured the port
which Germany had occupied in the Pacific, and so
eliminated any threat to her authority with which
that occupation might threaten her.
</p>

<p>
Within so few years did Japan thus pass, from
taking no part whatever in the Great Story, to be one
of the foremost actors.
</p>

<p>
Southward of the Japanese islands, the next most
important group is that of the Philippines, transferred,
as we saw, from the sovereignty of Spain to that of
the United States as a result of the Spanish-American
war of 1897-8.  Southward again, we come to those
islands of the Malay Archipelago chiefly dominated
by the Dutch, although Britain also has important
possessions there and on the Malay Peninsula itself.
</p>

<p>
And so, working yet farther southward through
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
innumerable islands, we arrive at the huge British
colonial territory of Australia, with the two islands
of New Zealand some twelve hundred miles away
towards the south-east.

SECTION III.&mdash;THE FAR SOUTH

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The far South
</span>
</p>

<p>
That vast and wonderful responsibility, the burden
of Australia, was laid so lightly upon the Anglo-Saxon's
shoulders that he has scarcely felt the weight
of it at all.  Although second to none, and equalled
only by one, namely America, in its immense possibilities,
it has been less costly in blood and treasure
than any other.  Partly this is because Australasia
lies so remote that no other nation has contested its
possession with Great Britain, and partly because the
Australian native himself is (or was, for he has nearly
disappeared) so poor a specimen of humanity that he
could put up no effective fight for the home lands from
which the white man was evicting him.
</p>

<p>
That is a remark, however, which by no means
applies to the native people of New Zealand, the Maoris.
They were and are a fine people of a very quick
intelligence, very brave, and distinguished for their
oratory.  We need not be surprised that they are so
different from the Australian natives, because, although
we often think of Australia and New Zealand as near
neighbours, they are, as already mentioned, twelve
hundred miles apart.  It is tolerably certain, from
the likeness of the language and other indications,
that the Maoris are of the same stock as the Samoans,
in Polynesia.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the eighteenth century that the
white man began to take much notice of these great
lands in the South.  New Zealand was the first to be
proclaimed a British possession, in 1787, and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
following year is the date of the beginning of the
settlement of New South Wales.  The founding of
the next Australian colony, Queensland, was not until
1824, and five years later again began the colonisation
of Western Australia.  South Australia was recognised
as a separate colony in 1834, and Victoria in 1851.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Australia
</span>
</p>

<p>
Of the settlement, and the claiming for the Anglo-Saxon,
of these glorious and vast possessions, there is
but little to say in this story, because each successive
settlement was accomplished with comparatively little
interference by the natives and with none whatever
from any other white nation.  The coast was found to
have some splendid harbours, most of the interior
was excellent grazing land, and later, profitable gold
mines were discovered.
</p>

<p>
The chief drawback of Australia as a cattle and
sheep producing country has always been its liability
to long droughts when no rain falls and the grass perishes
and the stock dies for lack of food and water.  Much
trouble arose at one time from the foolish and
short-sighted action of the Government at home in
transporting criminals thither.  In the first instance they
were sent to New South Wales and later to Queensland
also.  Many of these convicts escaped into the bush,
and, banding themselves together, became a terror,
by the name of bushrangers, to peaceful farmers.
Obviously the families of the convicts could not have
been brought up in circumstances likely to turn them
into good citizens.  It is all the more to the credit of
the country that it has such a fine population to-day.
</p>

<p>
The folly and the wickedness of thus filling up a
grand new country with the refuse ejected from the
old was gradually realised.  Transportation of criminals
ceased in 1868.
</p>

<p>
The Australian colonies continued to govern themselves
as separate units, under a constitution granted
them by the Crown in 1850, for just fifty years.  In
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
1900, by their own request, they were welded into the
Commonwealth of Australia, with a Governor-General
appointed by the Crown.  The federated States are
six, that is to say, New South Wales, Victoria, South
Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia on the
main land, with the island State of Tasmania to the
south.
</p>

<p>
Thus, shortly, it is possible to relate the story of
the white man's acquisition of this great continent of
the South; but though its story is so short and
simple the importance of the part that it is likely to
play in the future of this Greatest of all Stories is quite
beyond our estimate, but is certain to be very large.
Its vacant spaces, ready for the immigrant, are vast.
The difficulties created by the droughts are being
gradually overcome, as the means of irrigation are
improved.  The population is vigorous and efficient.
Australia sent fighters of splendid bravery and
splendid loyalty to aid the mother country in the
Great War.  The world has yet to learn the possibilities
of this young and still undeveloped continent.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The story of New Zealand is very much the story of
Australia, except that the New Zealand white settlers
did, for a while, suffer much anxiety in their
protracted warfare with the coloured race that they found
there.  It was not until 1861 that the Maoris took up
arms in any force against the whites who were gradually
driving them out of their ancient territories.  Had
they known how to combine and act together, and to
take advantage of the concealment of the bush, they
might have been really dangerous to the white man's
rule.  But jealousies between the tribes prevented
their combination, and a Quixotic pride in braving
death and danger seems to have caused them to deem
it the act of a coward to creep upon the enemy
undetected.  They chose rather to dash themselves upon
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
the defence in frontal attacks which cost them very
heavy losses.  Even so the war dragged on, in a series
of intermittent fighting, for ten long years, and in the
terms of peace which ended it the Maoris secured for
themselves better conditions than before.  Their
bravery and fine qualities had made an impression,
and they received a liberal recognition of their rights.
They have proved themselves good friends and citizens
of the Empire in the years since.

The products of New Zealand are very similar to
those of Australia.  On the whole its climate is more
agreeable, because cooler, to the European.  As
a stock-raising country it has the advantage of not
being subject to the same risk of droughts.  Assuredly
the white race thrives there and produces grand
specimens of humanity.  Even New Zealand has perhaps
not yet begun to play its full part in this Greatest
Story, but it has relatively little or none of the vast
empty space of the great Australian country.  We
may know, more or less, the role that New Zealand
is to play.  Of Australia's share in the drama of
the future it is scarcely possible to make even a
conjecture.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Thus then, in broad and simple lines, I have tried
to sketch the manner in which the white man, and the
Anglo-Saxon more than all other white men, has been
shouldering the world's burden.  That is a political
sketch, showing the movements of some of the societies
of men and some of the changes in the boundaries of
States.  But during the last hundred years of our
Greatest Story the principal events have been five, of
which three only have been of this political character.
There is the unification of Italy into a nation, that is
the earliest.  There is the consolidation of the German
States into the national unity of Germany, that is the
second.  There is the assumption of his burden by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
the white man, and especially of the Anglo-Saxon, all
the world over&mdash;that is the third.
</p>

<p>
The fourth and fifth are not of a political character
at all; though more important in our story than any
political event.  First of these last two, because it
came first in time, though I am not sure whether we
should rate it first in importance, is the application
of steam power to the working of machinery.  The
second is the discovery of evolution, with all that the
word implies, and its turning of men's eyes with glad
hope towards a splendid future for human life on
the earth, instead of a despairing regret for a vainly
imagined splendour in the past.

THE GREATEST STORY IN THE WORLD
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
By HORACE G. HUTCHINSON, B.A.
</p>

<p>
Vol. I&mdash;From the Beginning of History to the Dawn of the
Christian Era.  With Map and Illustrations.  3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
</p>

<p>
It is admittedly difficult to give to beginners just the proper
modicum of knowledge of ancient history to make the later ages
understandable, but such a task should
not be impossible, and it is hoped
that this book, which has avoided dates, names and details as far as
is consistent with sensible teaching,
may not fail entirely in its object.
</p>

<p>
The scene is laid in that centre of all early civilization, the
Mediterranean, and the fortunes of all the mighty nations that
lived and fought round its shores
are traced in bold outline: Egypt,
Crete, Babylon&mdash;the Jews, Greeks and Romans&mdash;all contribute
their chapters to this wonderful story.
The author finally gathers
all the threads together, and leaves the reader at Rome at the
dawn of the new era of Christianity.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Vol. II&mdash;The Further Story of the Old World up to the Discovery
of the New.  With Map and Illustrations.  3<i>s.</i>  6<i>d.</i>
</p>

<p>
The "Greatest Story" is here taken up at the point at which it
was left in the first volume; that is, about the year 100 A.D.
Throughout that first volume our land of Britain scarcely had a
place.  In the latter part of the period&mdash;100 A.D.-1500 A.D.&mdash;which
this second volume covers, men of Britain played a great role.  The
World story thus becomes, in some measure, England's also.
Moreover, where there have seemed to be two or more ways open
for the telling of the story, the author has always tried to adopt
what he calls the English way, the way which seemed likely to
bring it most warmly and intimately to English hearts and minds.
He has tried to adapt it for scholars perhaps a year or so older
than for those for whom the first volume was written.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Vol. III&mdash;The Development of the Modern World.  With
Illustrations.  3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
</p>

<p>
This third and final volume deals with the period which must
appeal more forcibly than any earlier time to all of Anglo-Saxon race.
</p>

<p>
The author, in his preface, explains how his work has been
inspired by Green's famous statement&mdash;that "England is only a
small part of the outcome of English history.  Its greater issues
lie, not within the narrow limits of the mother island, but in the
destinies of nations yet to be.  The struggles of her patriots, the
wisdom of her statesmen, the steady love of liberty and law in her
people at large, were shaping in the past of our little island the
future of mankind."
